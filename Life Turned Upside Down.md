# Life Turned Upside Down

## Chapter 1

### Shocked and Ashamed

It was late in the workday in early September 2009. The test automation wasn’t going to automate itself.Getting to the bottom of what the hell was causing the automated tests to freeze often provedfrustrating. Focus was required to remedy this 21st century issue.

My fixation on the screen was disturbed for a second; out the corner of my eye I could see a usuallyjubilant Wilson approach. His agitated expression concerned me; I’d never before seen this side of myjovial South African colleague. I looked away briefly to find the head space to gather my thoughts. I triedto over-ride my gut feeling and assert my approachable manner. Unfortunately, Wilson looked in greatpain; “Hi Wilson” I said, mimicking his expression. As Wilson’s gaze met mine, he said with in mournfulvoice “Phil is here to see you. You need to bring all your belongings.” Those words were like a powerfulelectric shock that ran through my body. My adrenaline began to surge; the mind was immediatelyoccupied with a multitude of contradictory thoughts… ‘Phil, why should he be here? He never appearswithout communicating his plans. Anyway, why isn’t he here in the office? Where downstairs is he?’ As Icontinued quickly, in step with a flustered looking Wilson, my thoughts began to wander. “ It’ll be goodto see Phil, I’m sure he’ll have some equally news; strange though, he’s never done spur of themoment.” Wilson and I continued our brisk walk outside, rounding the corner, and into the nearestavailable meeting room of the main office building.

The room was well lit and airy for such a small space. My attention was immediately grabbed by myboss’s suited and booted presence on the other side of small table. “Please take a seat Dave” he said inhis soft, droll, East Midlands tone. His face showed concern, a seriousness that I had experienced oncebefore, which resulted in a warning. He got to the point, “Dave, the laptop that you sent back to theoffice for repair was found to have explicit material on it. Our facilities management team have erasedthe material and all other media. Thankfully the sensitive material was not of a explicit nature, else wewould have had to involve the police.” He continued, “Did anyone else have access to your laptop otherthan you?” “No, just me.” I replied. “I can only say that I’m disappointed in you Dave. You have twooptions: refute the claims and face dismissal after a trial, or two, voluntarily leave.” It dawned on me atthat moment the weight of the circumstance.

The proverbial rug was being pulled beneath my 9-year career, working for the UK’s largest softwaretesting consultancy. The house… The mortgage... What are my family and friends going to say? I beganto feel rage, choosing to blame others for my misfortune other than myself. Firstly, FacilitiesManagement, “Those f*cking b*stards, why the f*ck did they choose to target me?” Secondly, HR, “Thereason Phil is here is because you f*ckers put your foot down and demanded that David Clarke shouldbe forced to leave. Those London f*ckers have got it in for me.” I lastly blamed Phil for being the vesselwith which this sh*t news logistically found its way to me. The rage subsided; the weight of thesituation began to slowly sink in “What would you do Phil if you were in my position?”. “Write a letter ofresignation here and now. You don’t want to drag this out.” Phil replied calmly. He got a piece of paper,a pen, handed them to me and dictated what I needed to write. I scribbled quickly, signing and datingthe form before placing it on the small table. I felt calmer, I stood up and shook his hand “Phil, you’re Life Turned Upside Down3 of 156the best Manager I have had the pleasure to work with.” He asked “Dave, would you willing to put thatin writing?” I smiled, looked at him with a feeling of care-freeness. “No Phil.”

We exited the small inquisition room and made our way to the foyer where Wilson awaited. He stillappeared flustered, all my personal belongings were strewn on the floor. He looked humbly at me; Ireturned a glance, indicating good bye and hopefully I’ll see you again. I hurriedly tried to collect myitems and exit the building with Phil at my side. Phil asked “where you heading?” I took my phone outmy pocket, took a look at the time and felt somewhat relieved I was finishing early. That thoughtinvoked my short- term schedule for the evening. The plan was to play indoor football then head back tomy home in Lichfield. I hesitated and indicated to Phil I was heading towards Aston University. Heconfirmed that he was heading towards the station, which was in the same general direction for thenext few metres.

I began feeling my brain disconnect from reality and enter an empty space devoid of feeling. The smalltalk that Phil cast my way was met with a limp, lifeless response. I was still going to take part in thescheduled indoor football game, I could not let my friends down. I relayed that information at least. Philshook my hand, wished me a hearty “all the best” before slowly disappearing down the street. I was leftfloating in an empty mind-set as I continued my walk towards Aston University.

At the leisure center I saw my friends and tried my best to slow down my body movements to indicate Iwas experiencing a level of discomfort. When the football match started, I was on the pitch with 9others, at the same time I wasn’t. The feeling of shock was still present and wasn’t showing any signs ofabating. My best friend Matthew Smith was on my team; when there was a break in the game, Idesperately reached out to him. “Smiffy”, I took a deep breath, “… I lost my job today”. He gave me anexpected quizzical look, his focus caught between the game and my outlandish statement, “what, er,why?” “I had explicit material on my laptop, nothing incriminating, just soft porn…” I said. The break inplay ended; Matthew’s focus immediately shifted to the football.

The game finished; I didn’t care for the score. We showered, changed and started to go our separateways. I thought about my next steps. What should I do now? I immediately thought of my supportnetwork. I wanted comfort, home; home being with mom and dad in the house I grew up in. My otherbest mate Doug, who played on the opposing side, lived close to my folks. As he said his goodbyes, Iimmediately hollered at him “wait, I’ll head out with you.” Slightly bemused he waited; as we approached the nearest bus stop; I built up the courage to explain my poor football performance.“Doug, I was laid off today.” He gave me a surprised look and paused, prompting me to explain further. Itook a deep breath and hesitantly explained; Doug was one of the most supportive people I knew. Herarely said a negative word, offering a positive window with which to view the situation while wetravelled. As the bus approached our stop Doug said “if you need any help mate, just give me a call.” Ithanked him for being there, for being a notice board for me to pin my worries on. It helped merehearse for, what I subsequently realised, was going to be the most challenging situation I was going toface, relaying what the day's events to my parents.

The suburb streets were dark, which in many respects should have helped focus my thoughts. Thefeeling of nervousness and tiredness clinched the focus from my grasp. I reached the front door of myparents’ house and opened it slowly with the spare house key provided to me. I walked into the loungeto my dad’s welcome surprise. He said hello and asked how work had been. I felt flustered; theadrenaline began to course through my system, before I give a sheepish, general reply. “Yeah, okay”. I Life Turned Upside Down4 of 156sat down. I looked over at my father and, with hesitation, began to elaborate on a general reply.“Dad...”, my jaw began to quiver uncontrollably, “I’ve been…”, I clenched my jaw shut as tears formed inthe corners of my eyes, “laid off.” I tried hard to hold back the tears as I clearly saw my dad taken aback.As he slowly reeled from the news, I continued. “My work laptop, they found porn on there.” “Nothingexplicit, standard stuff.” I could sense he was concerned, but not angry or upset by this news. Hisreaction was calm and reassuring. He began to do what fatherly figures should do; he offered hissupport.

Mom appeared from the kitchen and sat down, clearly surprised to see me. I relayed to her what I saidto dad. She was seemingly shocked and showed her concern. She offered reassurance in her quick-firedIrish accented manner. “Don’t worry David, you’ll live forever on a paradise earth. You just need tofollow Jehovah.” Good old mom, she just wasn't herself unless she relayed blurb from the Watchtowermagazines. “You can stay here for as long as you like.” I felt the stress burn away like sunshine at dawnpiercing the morning fog. I watched telly with Dad that night while mom spent time seeing to chores (anaspect of life for women of her generation). Slowly I felt calmer, Dad laid-back manner de-stressed meno end. The Friday night TV shows were entertaining too, which was nice. As the night progressedtiredness took the better of me. My mind, full of contrasting thoughts, slowly eased as my head meltedinto the lumpy pillow of my old bed.

The next morning I woke up suddenly, clear of thought. I was… normal… stress free… happy… I couldhear the radio blasting away with songs originating from my mother’s era. She sang a high-volumefalsetto, overpowering the radio track. A smile slowly formed across my face; I felt hungry, a sensation Ihad not felt since lunch time of the previous day. I flung the bed covers to one side and made my waydown the creaky carpeted stairs. My mother was always concerned about my stomach I.e., being fedwell. In her quick-paced tone she said “Now then what would you be liking?”, offering the contents ofthe fridge in a fried format. A smile appeared from the corners of my face as I exclaimed “I would love atoasted bacon sandwich with grilled tomatoes and HP sauce, my dwarling.” (“Dwarling” was one ofthose nicknames that I assigned to mom for reasons unknown. I found most of my inspiration for lifewas somewhat influenced by Monty Python’s Flying Circus and I’m sure that name, or something similarsounding, would have been deep in the recess of my subconscious and assigned to my mother on awhim.) I was a picky sod, even so at 30, but still less so than the pickiest eater of all, my dad or FussyFred.

The smell of the bacon cooking, cooked until burnt, as was the way with mom, filled the house. In hergreat waitress-like service, which I still didn’t appreciate and thank her for, she brought the bacon andbaked bean toasted sandwich into the lounge and plonked down on my lap. My stare temporarilydiverted from the TV to the plate, allowing me to locate the first crusty half with my right hand. Eatingthe toasted sandwich took my taste buds to a godly landscape where angels plunked on harps. It madesense why I never had a need to dabble with drugs; I just needed mom’s bacon and baked bean toastedsandwich to get me a high.

I showered and changed into my old casual wear that I handed-me down to my dad. I place my taintedwork clothes into an old backpack of mine. My thoughts were to ready myself for the journey toLichfield; Dad was up and asked if I needed a lift. He was heading to his brothers for a catchup and coulddrop me over at Marston Green Train Station. Or I could join him at Uncle Dave’s. I happily chose thelatter; I really enjoyed a visit to “Uncle D’s”.

Uncle D, aka Uncle David, aka David William Clarke, was hands down my favourite Uncle. The man wasintelligent, tall, laid-back; He never took life too seriously. He was well versed in all corners of life, butespecially that associated with the Midlands car industry. Dave had seen the rise of Leyland and the fallof Rover. He ended his career at LandRover aged 55; a retirement age that was unheard of for a bluecollar worker in Birmingham. In his lengthy career, from an apprentice to senior specialist in gearboxes,he had worked for one company that had changed hands and names multiple times. During the latterstage of his working life he would often bring round prototypes of vehicles to my Parent’s house. Myfondest memory of such vehicles was the V8 GTB: a ferocious, old fashioned 2-seater sports car. It was acacophony of muscular automobile audio and it didn’t half shift.

Dave’s wife Jane answered the door when we arrived. In her feminine, joyful tone she invited us to talea seat in the comfort of the lounge. Dave was sat, as he always was, on the sofa seat in the corner of theroom. It was the perfect place to appreciate the large, widescreen telly. In his soft, approachable tonehe asked, as he always had, “how are you? How’s work Dave?” Having already relayed my workpredicament to several people I was well versed and comfortable to deliver it to Dave. He respondedwith, unsurprisingly, words of comfort and support. The conversation continued and devolved intofactory talk, as it always did. The technicalities of the conversation were well beyond the realm of theaverage car lover; it moved to a conversation that only engineers could really appreciate. I rememberthe conversations of the past between my Dad and his brother, Uncle David; it had expanded myknowledge of the automotive industry and the biology of the motor car.

Aunty Jane was a great host, offering my Dad and I a wide choice of drinks: Tea, flavoured sparklingwater, Coffee or Cordial. Flavoured fizzy water came on the new wave of refreshment alternatives. Itsparked our interest, given it was sugar free, a boon for my diabetic dad. It was a beautiful drink,sparkling water with a hint of lime hit places most other drinks could not.

As Jane finished talking about her family a natural pause in the conversation appeared. It was a greatmoment for me and dad to say our goodbyes. We waved goodbye as we walked down the path thatpartitioned Dave and Jane’s from their neighbour’s. Sitting in Dad’s Toyota Avensis was a relief; theseats were some of the comfiest I have experienced before or since. The comfy drive to Marston Greentrain station, a stone’s throw from Uncle D’s, was an unwelcome sight. It felt like the first day at school,leaving the comfort of my parent and entering the unknown of the near future. I purchased a ticket andmade my way to the platform. With my mind undistracted it was left to wander. This was a dangeroustime; thoughts about my current situation soon set in. What the hell am I going to do?

The train weaved its way through Birmingham International, New Street and onwards north to my finaldestination, Lichfield City station. I remember on many a “big” sociable Friday night in Birmingham CityCentre catching the last train to Lichfield. The train journey was a good excuse to snooze; That wasdangerous, missing the Lichfield City stop meant a journey onwards to Lichfield Trent Valley. You wouldthink that the two stops, both being named after the 3-spired Cathedral city was easy to navigatebetween. This was far from the truth, with over a mile and a half of intersecting housing estate to Life Turned Upside Down6 of 156navigate, it was 30 minutes from home. Thankfully on this journey my mind was far too occupied toattempt a slither of shut-eye.

I opened the door to number 26: my vacant, quiet, 2 story town-house. I took my shoes off and placedthem in the vacant spot on the shoe rack near the wifi router. I hung my head and slowly walked intothe cold lounge. I sat on the fat, tanned, leather recliner, electrically adjusting the recline to almosthorizontal. I reached for my personal laptop. “booted it up”, “fired up” an internet browser and went tomy first area of solace, my personal email. There I crafted an email to explain my current predicamentand began adding friends, family and colleagues to the bcc field. _Send_ I sighed as I looked up and outto the view of my poorly maintained back garden. Thoughts of “how will this news be received…?” “Am Ireaching out to the right people?” I wanted so badly to right the wrongs. I wanted so badly to have myjob back. I felt so desperate, like everything in my current sphere of existence was only possible becauseof my job. “My material possessions cannot survive without an income stream” I thought. Withoutmoney coming in I felt the next step was to tighten the purse. I needed to reduce my outgoings. Wheredo I start? The TV? The car? What about the house! I have to do something about the house!!

It was late 2009, the housing bubble had burst in the midlands around July of 2007. The effects of thatwere coursing their way throughout the UK; terms such as “economic-crisis”, “economic-downturn”,“recession” were on everyone’s lips. No one had money and the ones who did weren’t going to spend itwhile dispossession after dispossession of property occurred. How did this affect me? I had originallybought my house for a cool £170,000 and owed over £150,000 to Alliance and Leicester. It was nowworth less than £140,000. If I sold now I’d have to find £10,000 from somewhere to make up thedifference owed. Was it even possible to sell the property as the current housing market stood? Whatwas the rental market like? I knew nothing about the ins and outs of that world. There was only one wayto find out, speak to the estate agents and get a slightly skewed feel for the consumers appetite.

The next day I composed myself and hesitantly through the back end of the estate to make my way tothe retail bonanza of Bore Street in Lichfield City. Thankfully all the estate agents were rubbingshoulders with one another at the near end of the street. It was going to be a "postman” style exercise,but instead of delivering post, I’d be delivering simple housing market questions.

I began the window-shopping session in a formal order:

1. Tydemans
2. Jaymans
3. Bill Tandys
4. Hunters
5. Chattings

Having popped in and spoken to a member of staff in each place, by the time I got to the bottom Borestreet I was well versed in my expectations. Yep, rental was going to be the way forward.

Chattings and Bergason Estate Agents signalled their interest, but would need to see the property firstbefore any contract negotiations could proceed. With my desperation clear the whole process to kick-offnow. The sooner the burden of paying the mortgage on the property could be alleviated, the less stressmy small shoulders would burden. Unfortunately, the feeling of immediacy was not reciprocated in theminds of the estate agents. It was more a “we’ll put an entry in the diary to visit you next week.” What,apart from thumb twiddling, was I going to do between now and then?

Chatting, i.e., speaking to not the estate agents, to my community was the best way I saw fit to spendmy time. With the maturing of the internet, especially social media sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn,it was easy to stay in touch with the ones that counted, my loved ones and colleagues. All it took was amessage, “I need your help!” Comfort to me, at the time, was more appreciated coming from my oldcolleagues in the form of prospective job leads and CV pointers. I tried the whole independent searchfor work via agencies and job websites. Being the one desperately in need of a job I felt in a terriblebargaining position. Every call arriving on my mobile phone made my adrenaline rush; I so wanted everycall to be “Dave, we found you the ideal job. It’s in your field of expertise, a stone’s throw from whereyou live, offering £40k+ and you start tomorrow!” I basically wanted my old job back; I yearned to stillbe there on the client’s site, working with amazing people and doing a job I knew like the back of myhand. What a pillock I was! I had it all and I let it slip away… I had low self-esteem and lacked respect formyself at that time.

What was left on the jobs front during “The time of turmoil”? In a word, nothing. Jeez, desperation evenled to me enquiring about getting my old job back. Funnily enough SQS-UK were in no mood to offer methat olive branch. I appreciated the kind words of assistance from old colleagues, it kept me in a positivestate of mind knowing that I had support. On the whole though there was nothing that could be seen aseven a glimmer of an opportunity.

My thoughts would soon change when, one morning when I booted up my parent’s desktop PC and firedup a web browser at LinkedIn, a message in an internet bottle washed ashore. It came all the way fromAustralia, from a person who introduced me to big world of the IT industry, Mark Pearce. “Looking forUK test consultants he knows who may want to be sponsored into fulltime employment in Australia.”the public board message read. I looked at this advert initially in a dismissive manner. I thought ‘yeah,would be nice to travel to Australia, but to live and work there…?’

As the days went by and my appetite for anything work related grew larger, Mark’s LinkedIn advert wassomething I couldn't help but keep on returning to. The more times I did, the more I would try to sell theidea, which seemed ridiculous at first, but plausible and exciting the more open to the idea I became.The question was “Why not?” Subsequent calls to my network of colleagues confirmed that they werehappy to assist me, but I should give Mark’s job advert consideration. That’s exactly what I did, settingaside the stubbornness and inner fears, I considered the words of my friends/ex-colleagues. Thatmorning I changed-up my usual routine writing an email straight off the bat to Mark Pearce,

> Hello Mark,
>
> I have now left SQS and am now seeking work opportunities. Do you have any further information wrt"looking for UK test consultants he knows who may want to be sponsored into fulltime employment in Australia"?
>
> Thanks,
>
> David Clarke

My heart raced as I clicked the “Send” button. While the idea of living and working in Australia wasstewing in my subconscious as the day progressed, my personal life was nearly ready to serve.

Chattings,the estate agents, agreed to become the acting landlords of my Lichfield property. They quickly foundtenants: A middle age couple, he worked in the Midlands, she worked in Manchester. My Lichfield homewould be there residential middle ground. They owned a dog; was I happy with the idea of a dogrunning around my fine fettled house? I began to warm to that idea, having briefly spoken to theaforementioned lady when she viewed my house the one day. She was a lovely person; The way mybrain worked, anything associated with her was going to be in the same light. I was happy in theknowledge that Chattings would ensure the tenant leave the property in a respectable state on theirdeparture. The letting agent phoned to inform the couple (and pet) could move in, in the next couple of weeks. It was at that moment I began to feel the burden of my financial responsibilities slowly loosen itsvice-like grip.

I excitedly returned to my emails that evening to see a reply with relation to the Australia job fromMark.

> “Dave,
>
> What happened ? I thought you were a lifer. As you may be aware I am now working for a TestConsultancy in Australia. I am always looking to bolster my ranks of good consultants, especially withpeople who I know and trust. My new company is registered to take on people via the 457 visa program.
>
> I have openings in Brisbane and Sydney at present. The company is very much in the mould of early days at Cresta. I have attached a guide to salaries so you have an idea of what is generally on offer.Let me know if you want to take it further.”
>
> As the days went by, so the email chain about the prospective new role grew. Prospects were splendidfrom home rental perspective too, the couple wanted to move in within the next week. Unfortunately, itdidn’t leave me with a great deal of time to move out (given all the property’s furniture needed to bevacated in its unfurnished offering). I had to think up a plan to complete the demonstrative task. I had afew ideas, eBay being only one of them. Talking to my logically minded father it was better if I involvedmy family in the initial house-wares sale. A spreadsheet of all items for sale were listed, categorised andsent (via email) to close friends and family. It was going to be first-come, first-serve, sale of the century!I left the price column blank, asking the prospective bidders to have their say on how much they wouldlike to pay. Items from the list took their time finding an appropriate buyer. After much prompting, withthe exception of a handful of items, everything found a home.

The tiresome task of transporting the items to their bidders was assisted with the use of a white FordTransit van and my brother. An optimistic morning’s work took the whole day, effortfully completednonetheless just as the sun began to set.

In many ways those weeks being out of work were a blessing in disguise. I moved in with my parents andgot the opportunity to spend more time with the people I loved. My parents were retired, but still activeday-to-day; my Mom was the local taxi for her elderly Jehovah’s Witnesses buddies. Every day thephone rang, in most cases the line of questioning by the caller was “is ya mam there?” In many cases Ihad to disappoint them, she was obviously out taxi-ing another “client”.

Dad was taking to retirement in a more relaxed fashion. His schedule was a mixture of DIY, cooking,fishing and meandering. The latter activity was a once-a-week joint adventure with my Uncle David.Uncle David loved sourcing new Midlands walking trails on the world wide web. He loved the www ingeneral purely based on the obscene amount of knowledge it held. When it came to walking trails, themore obscure they were, the more excited Dave got about trying them. He even went as far as sourcingblog sites that detailed unmapped walks in the Midlands. Given the time of year we often got muddy.Given the obscure source of the planned walks we often got lost too. Rest assured we always found apub that was strategically positioned at the trail’s end.

Fishing with Dad and his mates was another not to be missed weekly outing. Wednesday was “gofishing” time over at Barston Lakes with Ken, Alan, Malcolm (Dad’s mates) and Dad. It was “catch andrelease”, bragging rights were given for catching the single heaviest fish and the heaviest bag of fish.Those honours were cemented with a pint at Stonebridge Island Pub after the last set of fishing tacklewas packed away. Dad’s mate were old school, their views on life lacking the depth of today’s culturallysensitive individuals. They often talked about the past through rose tinted glasses. “Do you rememberwhen…” was often said. Sledging was much a part of their culture as was the way the drinks roundswere organised. Back in their day (they all would have been 20 somethings in the 1960s) they wouldn’thave thought twice about getting drunk and driving home. At the pub, post fishing session, theystretched the drink/drive limit law. Let’s just say that I thankfully didn’t have to drive home, havingdrunk the same quantity as each member of the group.

## Chapter 2

### Time to Transition

One day, out with Dad and his fishing buddies at the Lakes, I was checking my email when I noticedsomething interesting. An email from Mark Pearce! I excitedly, but apprehensively clicked on saidmessage. Up popped the mail in all its opportunistic glory. The contents spelled out interest in bringingme to his team in Sydney, Australia. He stated his willingness to sponsor my work visa applicationthrough the “457 scheme”. I was filled with trepidation. I didn’t understand the process, what wasrequired of me and what the timelines were from job/visa application.

Mark got me in touch with the company HR department where the to-ing and fro-ing ofcommunications continued. Sydney, Australia was 9 hours ahead of UK time. My conversations, mainlywith HR, happened often during their lunch time, 3am GMT. I would often fall to sleep, trying to stay uptill said unearthly hour. Being woken up and coherent at that time in the morning after a brief spell ofdeep sleep was as easy as getting fat. Thankfully the telephone line was clear as a bell; conversationsmanaged to prove fruitful and amazingly after a period of only 4 weeks my electronic 457 visa camethrough.

It was late October 2009, nearly 2 months after my fateful meeting with Phil, I had been granted anAustralian visa and successfully gained employment with an Australian software testing consultancy.Australia, a massive country located the other side of the world; a place I had only seen in films and soapoperas. The dream of working again was now a reality. Still, through all the excitement there were deep,stomach-churning, “what the fuck am I doing”, doubts playing in my head.

To turn the news into more than just words in an email I announced it to my family, mates andcolleagues. By announcing it that the news went from an idea to a plan. Surprisingly, everyone wassupportive, but I could sense their disappointment. It was at that moment I appreciated the value Iadded to those who I surrounded myself with. Selfishly, I had to split those ties for the sake of work.Was work higher priority than my family and friends? The culture accepted it, work was one of life’srequirements. Why? Work was society’s back bone. Years in school and further education prepared usfor it. It was part of our identity and in many ways defined who we are. I wanted my identity back;Australia was going to be the land to had it back to me.

One morning, back at my parents’, I fired up the family computer and navigated to the Emirates website. I entered potential flight dates, Birmingham International Airport to Sydney, Australia. I wantedto get a feel for how much this was going to cost me (this cost would come out of my pocket)!? Flightson the weekend were a lot more expensive than mid-week ones. With my bank somewhat depleted from a lack of wages for a couple of months, my mind was focused on getting the best bang for buck. Unfortunately, it would mean having to leave sooner than I’d hoped.

Without consulting a soul, I hesitantly went through the booking process. The prices that appearedweekday and weekend for one-way travel were not much different from one week to the next; so, theearlier mid-week, the better. I was step 5 of 6 in the booking process; I put much effort into ensuring thedebit card details I entered were accurate. My heart raced as I clicked the submit button. Thecongratulatory confirmation page appeared, £800 had been ripped from the heart of my pitiful currentaccount. That was it, no possibility of a refund, I was now a committed traveller to Australia, the otherside of the bloody world. It was at that moment that the doubts dissolved and the headrush began. Ihadn’t this much elation in my all my life. I was going to Australia! Wow! I best think of a detailed plan ofattack.My mom popped into the dining room on her way to the kitchen. I stopped her in her tracks and, with asmile on my face, delivered the “good” news. “Mom, in 4 days-time (November 5th) I fly out ofBirmingham Airport, en-route to Sydney.” She paused and looked at me; not with the beemingexpression she usually gave, it was one I saw before, disappointment. It was difficult not to read thenegativity in her body language. “Oh, good”, she continued walking into the kitchen. My elation beganto deflate as I thought again about how this decision could affect my family. I couldn't help but feelselfish and question what ultimately I wanted from this experience.• Work first and foremost• Travel experiences secondly• A kick up the arse thirdly.‘I’ll give it 2 years and see how it goes’ I thought.. A thought I would later return to again and again.Life refused to slow between the time I booked the flight and the day I was to visit BirminghamInternational Airport. I felt organised, there was little left that required my physical presence in the UK.My house was to be inhabited by new tenants. My household goods were all but sold to close family andfriends. Flights booked, bags packed, accommodation organised by Mark and his cronies.I did my best to ensure I was going to hit Australia running. My soon to be boss Mark advised I shouldhead to my local HSBC to setup an Aussie bank account; that would save me some time before headingover. One of the outstanding tasks from Mark’s Company’s HR department was details of a currentaccount. Unfortunately, it wasn't straightforward as Mark had pictured. Having secured an appointmentwith an HSBC advisor, the advice given was “it’s far easier to set up a bank account when I was over inSydney”. With that, after food, water and shelter I prioritised the task of opening a bank account when Ireached Sydney CBD.My next and most immediate task was packing, packing for a new life. How do you pack for a new life? Icould only reflect on trips I had embarked on recently. The thinking process around those excursionswas to throw in flip-flops, shorts and a pair of speedos. I knew according to the weather forecast for Life Turned Upside Down12 of 156Sydney that it was going to be a hot one, so I wouldn’t have to bring my woollens, but I needed to wearsomething to shield me from the conditions here before flying out. I rummaged around my parents tosee what I could find; I had completely forgotten about my snorkelling wears. What better anopportunity to use them, but they were bulky. The fins alone just about fit into my large samsonitesuitcase, which did a fine effort swallowing most of my wears. Some of the “overspill” would be make itsway into my small backpack. Unfortunately, some items would have to stay in the UK. There was a hopethat a point soon I would return and claim the remainder.The day came; I had planned as well as I could have. It was now time to catch the first leg of the flightfrom Birmingham International Airport to Dubai. Mom and dad were, just like concerned parents shouldbe, happy to see to it I was there to check in to my flight at least 3 hours before it departed. It was niceto be chauffeured in the family Toyota Avensis, “the princess” as I called it. The car was parked in theshort stay, a mere one-minute walk from the airport’s main entrance. Emirates, the flight operator, hadnearly half of the departure lounge dedicated to their operations. Money = power, as they say.So there I was, waiting in the queue to check in, passport and flight ticket in hand, dressed in T-shirt andjeans. Mom and dad did a fine job making me anxious by asking round of embarrassing, interrogativequestions e.g., “did you pack your verruca cream? You know your skin flares up when you don’t…”. Itwas a relief to be called up to the check-in counter. I handed over my passport and was asked to lift myluggage onto the conveyor/scales. As the numbers on the LCD began to increment, I began to stress. Iwas dumbfounded why my luggage was so heavy. Maybe my parents had thrown in the kitchen sinkwhile I was occupied!? Well, something had to be taken out to drop its weight below the allowance. Ipulled the luggage to one side. With my parents’ assistance, we began shifting some of weight. Thequestion was, what was I going to remove and what was I going to do with it? I frantically began takingout some of the outer wears with my parents assistance. I did what was akin to an episode of Friendswhen Joey wore all of Chandlers clothing in one effort. Wearing the larger outer clothing allowed me tofocus on the smaller items of luggage. All of those were then painstakingly condensed and squeezed intomy onboard luggage, which would add to my weight while onboard. What a palava! After packingreorganisation sheningans, my brow and additionally clothed body was laden with sweat. Not a goodlook, not particularly comfortable either; additional outer layers were trapping the heat and regulatingmy elevated temperature. I sighed, first world issues; better to have brought too much than too little.After a successful second attempt to check in, Mom, dad and me made our way upstairs to thedeparture lounge entrance. I fell silent and looked at my parents. Mom added a cursory statement “wellthat’s it now” as the escalator reached the top. I saw the cordoned off area where a small number ofpassengers were queueing. I slowly turned to face my parents: I hugged my mom and kissed her. Dadwas not a “touchy feel-y” person, which made me hesitant about how I should greet him farewell. Iknew the handshake was acceptable in all my social circles; I reached for his hand. In the moment afterour handshake disconnected, I felt compelled to hug him. He slowly reciprocated; it was a short momentthat felt like it lasted an eternity. As I loosened my embrace, I turned to face the departure lounge,walked a few steps, and waved back to my parents. I could clearly see tears in my dad’s eyes. I had tobite my lip to stop myself from crying. I continued to wave and onwards I ventured to the security gate.Birmingham International Airport was once my part-time place of work; a supplementary income for my6th form education in the late 90s. Back then I worked at the UK retail giant WHSmith. Back in my daythey had shops in all areas of the airport: check-in, land-side (pre-departures) & air-side (departure Life Turned Upside Down13 of 156lounge). I finished after 4 years’ service; I was told on leaving that I was close to being promoted tosupervisor. I’m sure that would have been an interesting chapter in my life, but possibly would havederailed the Australia life opportunity that lay ahead.The number of WHSmith stores in the airport were less than I anticipated. It looked like there wasanother newsagent that had taken tender turf. How did that happen? On who’s watch? In the departurelounge I took whistle-stop tour of the shops starting with the duty-free, the fleeting focal point of anyairport departure lounge. The duty-free section never failed to amaze; “how can so many fragrances coexist in the same market?”, I uttered to myself. I tried not to look at the staff, a sure sign of interest; Iapplied a look of textbook disinterest and trundled on.It had been well over 8 years since I last worked at WHSmith. There was a hope that when I moseyed oninto the store, I would be surrounded with adulating workers. In such a transient environment were anyI had the pleasure, and in some cases the agony, of working with still working there? I looked towardsthe check-outs to gawp at the staff. Who were these strangers? Where was the magazine stackerMatthew Eton, the confectionary expert Anthony Bailey or the big boss lady Kim? More importantly,where was the “Dave’s WHSmith Work Home Coming” celebrations? ‘Ah shit!’ I thought before headingover to the car magazine section, sighing and flicking through the automotive news. Even though Iwasn’t a car enthusiast, I admired them. They were relatable things that my family appreciated.As I skimmed the final pages of Car magazine, I looked up at the departure information screen. The gatefor Emirates flight to Sydney, Australia, via Dubai, was opening. Which gate? Yep, found it. It was now amatter of leaving the comfort of the departure lounge and walking down a tunnel to the arse end of theairport.I could see the queue for the Emirates gate from a comfortable distance away. It was a good 50 peopledeep already, with plenty of folk still confined to the jail-like gate seating area. As I walked to the end ofthe queue, I took a good look at my soon to be flight neighbours. What I wasn’t expecting was to seeanyone recognisable. ‘Was that?’ my brain wasn’t firing on all cylinders. It took a while to put the facesto names, in this case a popular Birmingham rock band. Bloody hell, it’s Moseley’s finest, Ocean ColourScene. A “back in the day” band that signalled memories of drinking unhealthy amounts of alcohol,hitting the dance floor & positioning traffic cones on monuments. Good times? Questionable, but thetunes that accompanied those days in the late 90s were bloody awesome.Maybe this journey would be special, given Ocean Colour Scene’s presence. As I waited patiently in thequeue I peered out through the huge, bright departure gate windows. I knew the plane was going to bebig, given the distance it was to travel, but nothing prepared me for the scale of the Emirates A380. Itwas the big foot monster truck of aircraft with an upper and a lower deck. It had to be special, given thelength of time I was going to be using it for; Anything less than monster just wouldn’t cut the mustard.After my boarding pass and passport were checked I saw the passenger tunnel(s) to the A380’sentrances. An endless labyrinth with signs indicating seat numbers and class levels. I made aconservative guess, finding another queue. As I made it to the doorway to the entrance I steppedthrough, greeted by humble, female staff wearing a sari, red cap and a brown business suit. Being a Life Turned Upside Down14 of 156parochial brummie lad, the elegant, foreign, yet smart attire of the crew caused me to ogle. Thankfully,after a flick of the head I regained my composure. I showed my boarding pass, which usually resulted ina nod of the air host/hostess’s head. This time around I was given runway style directions, given themultiple isles of seating.I walked past the space-age capsule seats of first and business class entered standard class. This wasn’tno ordinary standard class; it was HUGE and more importantly it was EMPTY! I had at my disposal a bankof 4 seats all to myself. If only I had a mattress, I thought. I sat down, I felt an immense sense of joy fromtaking off multiple outer layers. My skin could breathe again; my body felt unshackled. I stretched myneck and lay my eyes on the back of a seat headrest in front of me. What was this? I had experiencedin-flight entertainment before, but this, this was something taken from the future. What faced meenveloped my periphery. Is that a “wide” screen!? I excitedly reached for the controller that formed partof the console beneath the “viewing platform”. This controller, much like a coin, had two sides. One wasa straightforward interpretation of the couch potato’s TV controller. The other side of the remote mademe reminisce of the golden era of home console gaming. What entertainment possibilities lay ahead?What have they not packed into this? In the meantime, while the default, unchangeable flight pathscreen was visible, I just had to wait. It was a time to get comfortable and aware of my surroundings,especially the location of the bathrooms and staff cubicle areas. Dubai was a good 8-hour journeyahead. I wanted it to be stress free, with as much entertainment time that my brain could possiblyprocess.One thing I love about long haul flights, apart from the video entertainment, is the free-ness ofeverything. Space maybe tight by the standards we are used to in everyday life, but by aircraft standardsthis plane’s cabin room was more than ample. What was more awesome was the available elbow space.The row of 4 seats, which 1 of I was assigned to had no other passengers assigned to them. This mademe think about the possible sleeping configurations that figuratively lay before me. Firstly though, to“stop the dogs barking” I had to take off my shoes. I noticed that Emirates had supplied a nice little bagof onboard nighttime comforts: toothpaste, blind fold, slippers and bed socks. In my whole 30 years onthis planet I had not tried bed socks, now was the time. Of all life’s experiences I wouldn’t say I wasblown away by the generic, one size fits all, bed sock wearing experience. At least it made me appreciatethe socks I took off, which did fit me. Now, to find the nearest toilets. I was blessed, if you’re of apositive disposition, with a very weak bladder. It had dogged me all my life. Knowing where the toiletswere in any establishment was a “must know” requirement. With the few people on board, the largenumber of toilet cubicles and no one obstructing my passage to the porcelain shrine I was as happy as athirsty racehorse.I was “buckled up” and ready to go. After a surge from the mighty Rolls-Royce jet engines, a climb tocruising altitude and with seat belt signs turned off, I took a look around me. People were staring attheir in-flight entertainment systems like zombies watching a show about autopsies. I sat back down and“do as the Romans do”, absorbed. Films, Games, TV Episodes of great US and UK favourites filled mysenses. While the joy of this 21st Century experience continued, the serving of meals (presented inaccordance with a printed set menu), were served around the clock. I was even able to have additionalmenu items if I so wished, which I did, by asking the staff. This felt too good to be true; what was the Life Turned Upside Down15 of 156catch? For a moment there I had forgot, I had spent the bad end of £1000 to experience this. This wouldbe the all the impetus I required to eat every last stone of that diamond cake I made.We arrived at Dubai Airport on their evening. I was tired, my body knew it was late in the UK night. I alsoknew that the layoff at Dubai Airport, while passengers waited for their connecting flight, would bemany hours. I either needed bed, a beverage or a night club to try and kick my awareness into gear. As Ireached the immense hanger that was the Dubai Airport Departure Lounge, I performed a recce of theairport. Shop, café, newsagents, duty free… I walked and walked; it was then I saw it. It reminded me ofa shipping container, there was a restaurant on the first floor, but where were the stairs? They were outof view, but accessible. I thought it appropriate to take a look at said restaurant, so I climbed the stairs.What I didn’t realise as I got to the first floor was the huge bar, out of sight from the departure loungethoroughfare. The bar had a selection of many worldly alcoholic beverages. Me, being partial to a pint ofthe black stuff placed a Guinness order. Immediately before pouring he announced the price. I did adouble take, and hesitantly reached for my wallet. £5 for a pint back in 2009 was more than double thegoing rate at the local. It even made the night club prices pale in comparison. I closed my eyes andunwillingly handed the money over. The bar man asked me to take a seat. One of the other staffmembers then showed me to the lounged area behind the bar. I quizzically looked at the large lounge. Iwas handed a remote control. As I bemusedly looked at the device, the large widescreen TV that laybefore me and sumptuous leather sofas, my pint arrived. It was perfectly chilled and accompanied by aselection of salted nuts. I smiled as I set my luggage down and melted into the seating. I pointed thecontroller at the TV, pressed the ON button and absorbed the hymn sheet of channels that cascadeddown the screen. It was then I saw it, being a big martial arts fan at the time, Ultimate FightingChampionship. I selected the Xtreme Sports Channel that housed the programme, placed the controllerdown, reached for a generous helping of nuts. As the crunchy nut fragments filled my mouth I reachedfor my pint. The cool, smooth, roasty tones of the Guinness complemented the snacking envionmentthat lay before it. I lay there, content as a pig in pig shit. A smile beamed from my face like a lighthouseas I watched 2 martial arts experts beat ten bells of shit out of each other.The tiredness took its toll. As awesome as watching & relaxing in a living room in a pub was. what I reallywanted was bed. I felt I had to keep awake, after watching the concluding moments of the main UFCevent (it ended in Frank Shamrock causing his opponent to tap out) I made it back to the concourse for awander. It wasn’t the most comfortable of walks lugging around an onboard suit case, wearing winterwears in the temperature-controlled climate of the modern electronic feedback loop installed in therafters. As I walked on, I saw what can only be described as the sun loungers: Long bed like leathercovered seating shaped like its sun lounger cousin. The loungers I initially saw were taken, to myannoyance, but I wasn't shocked by this discovery. It’s all about supply and demand, on this occasionsupply outstripped demand or so I was led to believe. I walked on, staggering more so than walking, mybrain experiencing a dull fuzz that I couldn't shake. It was then, as what happens when you least expectit, when I saw them, free loungers. ! I looked to the heavens beyond the high ceiling and said a thankyou. I’m not sure why I do that, I’m not religious, maybe subconsciously I want something super naturalto reply with the equivalent of a wink or a thumbs up. I literally leapt onto the bed like structure andtried to get comfy. After much faffing I got my contorted body into, what I thought was, the ideal Life Turned Upside Down16 of 156sleeping position. The position was akin to the foetal position, with pike (I’m not sure what that means,but it sounds respectable in the pool diving circles). I closed my eyes and… I felt my heart racing, myadrenaline pumping. I was still so excited about the journey ahead that the slideshow of thoughts justwouldn’t stop. The body can be a cruel beast. The contradiction of excitement and tiredness… Itreminded me of Christmas time as a school kid. Funny, looking back, Christmas Eve was the night Iwanted to pass by the most. It ended up being the longest night of the year. My brothers and I wouldclock watch till the dials fell off.I again thought about moving from the makeshift nest of the lounger to… somewhere else… but where?I thought that maybe I could amplify the adrenaline rush with a dose of caffeine. The Costa Coffee shopwas a welcoming, but quiet environment thanks to the time in the morning. Thankfully there was a freshfaced barista operating the espresso machine. I sat with the piping hot, frothy coffee on the table. Islowly looked around at the vacant space that lay before me. With one hand clasping the saucer and theother triggering the coffee mug, I slowly consumed the contents of the hot beverage. The taste, textureand caffeine hit made for a brief euphoric experience. The short-lived hit was worth the money spent,but the intended state of mind that I was reaching for did not persist as I had hoped. What I reallyneeded was intravenous, drip coffee.I was soon on the move again, but this time my body began to wake from its dullened state. As I walked,I looked out of the huge window that staged the airport run way. The sky, a maddening rea colour, wasilluminated further by the rising sun. I stopped, sat down, keeping my gaze firmly at its powerful glow. Itcontinued to rise and began to hurt the eyes. I looked away and then at my phone. Not long to go till Icatch the connecting flight; the adrenaline kicked in again.After reading what appeared to be a every single car magazine in the airport’s newsagents, I waited in alarge queue at the Emirates departure gate. Like orderly ants we followed our business, first andstandard class routes. I was more than happy to be back in the environment I got so accustomed tohours earlier. Following my prior onboarding procedure, I walked to my seat, reached for the night socksand “re-engaged” the onboard entertainment unit. As I lifted the controller, I talked to the unit as onewould converse to another human being, ‘Where did we get to?’.Life Turned Upside Down

## Chapter 3

### Heaven and a Half Pint

Another feature I love with regards to large passenger aircraft is how they land on airport run ways; It isa buttery smooth experience. Barely a bump was felt as we touched down at Sydney Kingsford SmithAirport. As we taxied to our arrival gate, I looked outside to see the sun shine and heat pulsate abovethe runway. I looked over at the main building and saw a sign that read “Welcome to Sydney”. Therewas a slight delay in the response from my head; it then hit me. I’m here, I’m in Sydney, I’m the otherside of the world! I never thought I would be thinking that so soon in my lifetime. This euphoricdistraction was a temporary reprieve from realising that my body and mind were zonked from all thetravelling.The plane came to a smooth halt at the arrival gate. I gathered my cabin luggage and looked out thewindow; This was the place I was going to call home for the foreseeable future. I looked back at myplane seat/s. I would like to have said that a part of me died during that journey… and there it was, lefton the plane ready to be cleaned up by the plane preparation staff. Au revoir dead skin cells!As I exited the plane into the fresh air, I winced. Jeez it was so bright here, like someone had peeled theprotective layer off the sun. The humidity hit me straight away. The thought of being outdoors in warmbright conditions at the start of November left me confused. Welcome to the Southern Hemisphere Ithought. It wasn’t going to be a thought that I could fully comprehend; another thought then consumedmy mind as I walked to the security gate ‘have I done everything that needs to be done in order to gainentry to Australia?’ I looked down at my boarding card; it had a multitude of tick boxes relating to ‘Haveyou recently been to country…’ Thankfully, I hadn’t travelled much up until this point, as indicated bythe glut of visas. I realised that my passport had nothing in it to indicate I was allowed to enter Australia.Sure, I had applied and successfully applied for a work visa, but where was evidence of this in mypassport?I handed my passport and boarding card to the passport control officer who looked carefully at mydocumentation and then at me. The officer’s Aussie droll that enveloped the English language he usedreaffirmed I wasn’t in some British outpost. He asked “where’s your visa?” I hesitantly replied “I have a457, working visa”. His confused gaze made me feel really nervous. He passed my British passport to hiscolleague who took it to an electronic terminal behind him. I saw the passport being scanned andhanded back to the first officer. The passport was opened to a fresh page; a stamp with an entry datewas firmly applied. As the passport was passed back to me a huge sigh of relief emptied out of my body.My next goal, as I walked down the steps, was to wait for my luggage at the carousel.luggage arrived drama free; as I walked through the “Declare or Nothing to Declare” embarkation zoneinto arrivals I noticed the Vodafone booth; ‘bloody hell’, I thought, ‘the unlucky sods they haveVodafone here too’. Funnily, Vodafone was one of the worst performing service providers in the UK. Iwondered, with everything being down under and t’other way, was Vodafone the best mobile provider?I had a gander at their stand where I was immediately spoken to by an enthusiastic employee (well, allAussies were enthusiastic by the British yardstick). I took some literature from the stand and trotted on.I looked up and saw a set of large public transport signs; I immediately followed the sign that indicated Life Turned Upside Down18 of 156trains. I've always been a lover of the rail; this appreciation was heightened on a recent trip to Japan. Iwalked to the ticket booth to make an enquiry; I asked for a single ticket to the city. The train guardindicated I needed 2 tickets: a special ticket to enter the platform at the airport and one to exit when Ireached the city centre. When the price of said tickets was stated I was taken aback. How much?Working on a rough exchange rate of 2 AU$ to the £, the cost was still north of £20. This was anunadulterated one-way, 20-minute journey into the city centre from the airport. Given this was the firstitem I had purchased in Sydney I thought this would set the precedence of all retail goods. ‘How was Igoing to financially survive?’As I waited on the platform at the Sydney Airport Train Station the train arrived. It was like nothing I hadseen before; a double decker train! On boarding, I took then lower deck given the weight of my luggage.As I sat-down I soon realised how much space I was consuming and how difficult it was to keep theluggage close to hand. After managing to shepherd my wheeled suitcases I felt a little claimer. It wasthen when I noticed I was people watching. I was fascinated by the passengers on board; their fashionsense, spoken word & mannerisms were alien to me. The most shocking observation I made was theclothing the young teen girls were wearing. The denim shorts weren’t just short, a belt would be abetter description. The shorts were wedged so far up their arse that from a foreigners’ perspective theylooked like the buttocks had consumed them. A couple of “short-arses” sat in the seats in front of meand commenced chatting away. What hit me initially was the terse terminology the girls used. I was verymuch used to the way the more reserved English woman spoke. The “Aussie Gal” was blunt, to the pointand willing to describe details in all their dirty glory. Aussie girls didn’t “beat about the bush” so tospeak.I noticed that me, the observer, was the observed. The ladies prying eyes were set upon me fromvarious sections of the train. I was wearing a black T-Shirt with an emblazoned, white cycling emblemacross the front. My legs were covered in tight, dark blue jeans, set off by a pair of narrow, pointy,brown shoes. With my three, upper body focussed, training sessions a week physique, bulking up myclothing, I struck an impressive stature.My paranoia waned as out the corner of my eye I could sense the impending Sydney City Scape. TheSkyscrapers towered just in front of the Circular Quay area, rising like futuristic shards out of a sci-fimovie. The only city I could compare like-for-like was Toronto, Canada. Both were new-h in colonialterms and both appeared extraordinarily concentrated. Sydney’s skyline was unmissable with its largeShangri-La and CN Tower buildings. The two other noticeable landmarks were the Sydney HarbourBridge and Opera House.The harbour at Circular Key, which encompassed the cityscape, was a hive of activity. Passenger boatswere arriving and departing in a fascinating coordinated fashion. This was my stop according the sheetof A4 paper containing the Google Map print out. The next part of my journey, according to sheet 1, wasto get from Circular Quay to my accommodation. The HR department of the new place of work,consisting of one staff member, Leanne, booked the accommodation a good distance away from mynew place of work. This apartment was out of the way, in no way central, which I’m sure would havecost the consultancy an “arm and a leg”. It made me think of my previous place of work, which housedon the axiom of “as long as it’s cheap, it’ll do.” The accommodation was a 2-floor apartment block,good, located directly beneath a busy Aussie freeway, bad. Life Turned Upside Down19 of 156I turned to sheet 3 of my print outs. Details of how to enter the apartment were present in all theirglory. Thankfully the instructions were illustrated; I just needed to find the dull brown key safe and enterthe number sequence 9876 (a secure number if ever there was one). On entering the numbercombination, the key store immediately sprung open, revealing a set of keys. It was like a moment fromthe legendary video game Zelda, the accompanying music played sinuously in my head. On opening thedoor to the apartment there was a lack of walls. The openness of the apartment environment wassomething I was not used to, having lived in a terraced house for a couple of years. It was interestinghaving the bedroom, lounge and kitchen in one large room; you could literally watch your eggs fry fromthe comfort of your own bed. I did love the natural light levels; it poured in through the windows on theone side of the apartment and diffused through the beige stained veiled curtains.I decided to take a closer look at the apartment's contents; each cupboard and drawer was opened tofamiliarise myself with their contents. The faster I acclimatised, the better; this abode I would be callinghome for the next 2 weeks. There wasn’t much, or nothing particularly striking about the contents. Youcould say that my inquisitive needs were starved. I turned to my bag and began to rifle through thecontents. Clothes, clothes and more clothes. Ah! I had located my electronic gadgets and other PCrelated goods. I had a gander at the back up CDs that I had “burnt”: Microsoft Office 2003, MyDocuments, Movies, TV Show Episodes, then I saw it, my porn collection.I loved soft-porn; women with huge mammary glands stimulated my libido. I didn’t realise at the timethat I had an unhealthy addiction to this material. The adrenaline rush prior and the orgasm thatresulted post masturbation was a high that I couldn’t get enough of. The 2 days I had spent travelling toSydney, 2 days without masturbating was probably the longest period of time in years where I had gone“cold turkey”. As I looked at the CDs of pornography, I felt anger; my reliance on it was the prime reasonI had lost my job in the first place. Having travelled all this way, did I want to continue viewing thisaddictive material, frowned upon by the wider community? I took the CDs and, one-by-one, broke theminto shards and poured the remnants into the bin. It was an empowering feeling, with a hint of regret.Like all addictions it was eating away at my conscious thoughts. Even though I had rid myself of the CDs,it didn’t stop me wanting it, needing it. Where did I draw the boundary? Was I to stop masturbating *fullstop* or masturbate under certain, respectful, allowable conditions? Was the latter even an acceptableconcept? As I attended to these thoughts, I began to accept masturbation as healthy under thecondition it wasn’t stimulated by pornographic material.That conclusion gave me all the permission I seeked to continue on this sinful behaviour. As I orgasmedand felt the temporary high that I seeked, I took a deep breath out and regained my focus. I still had alist of jobs as long as my arm that needed completing. I changed into clothes more conducive to theSydney summer and made my way to the bright beat of the street near the highway.It was lunch time; the streets of Sydney CBD were buzzing with workers hanging around St Martin’sSquare and George Street. I did what every tourist does in an unfamiliar environment, I gawped ateverything. The shopping arcade on George Street impressed upon me a feeling of British pride. Detailsof its colonial heritage were placarded in its Victorian architectural cues. As I exited and looked acrossthe cross roads I was hit by a vision. “Is that… Woolworths!?” I said aloud. Woolworths had recentlyclosed down in the UK, but it appeared to be alive and well on the city streets of Sydney.As the pedestrian crossing indicated all was safe to proceed, I walked diagonally across the road and inthrough the entrance of “Woolies”. My initial observations were one of amazement. First and foremost Life Turned Upside Down20 of 156this shop was a super market, not a hodgepodge of discounted goods like it’s UK cousin. There were 3floors; the lower ground level extended it’s reach into the train station of Martin’s Square. I took afurther look, initially observing the fresh fruit and veg section in detail. Bloody hell, the bananas wereexpensive. These mangoes are huge! What’s that? A watermelon!? I was like a kid in a sweet shop. Iperformed an assessment of each aisle, on each floor. As the minutes went by, my paranoia increased. Icould feel the security system was eye-ing my every action. I did what any law abiding citizen should do,perform an act of charity: buy the cheapest item in the shop before getting a move on.I still had a number of tasks that needed completing:1. Open a bank account (this would help with getting paid)2. Organise a mobile phone contract.The sun was blazing on the high street. Where were all the banks? I know Mark Pearce had mentionedsetting a HSBC account over in the U.K. Where was the main Sydney city branch? I hadn’t a clue whichother banks were prevalent. I began to wonder about banking considerations. Which bank offered thebest interest rates, the coolest websites, the most cashpoints. I was clueless and nervous; I knew once Ihad chosen a bank it would be a ball ache to change. I had to get it right, I had to be thorough. Whydidn’t I do all the necessary research online prior to getting to Australia?! Fiddly dee.As I turned the corner I, by luck, saw a HSBC branch and merrily entered. I asked a few questions to thestaff about rates, eligibility etc., and merrily exited. I saw another bank, Commonwealth, an intimidatinglooking bank with security watching my every move. I again entered, chatted to a member of staff andexited. As I continued my hunt, a bank grabbed my attention with it’s Orange logo and its offer of a highinterest current account. Bank West; I walked in, it felt more intimate than the other financialinstitutions, more like a set of stalls than a shop front. I was immediately invited to take a seat and skimthrough their list of retail banking products. I was immediately drawn to their most basic product, acheck account with no debit card. The interest on the account was sky high. Given the financial crisisthat had gripped the UK at the time, driving it’s interest rates to an historic low, anything north of 2%was special. Bank West we’re offering a ridiculously high 5%. It was a good time to be in Australia andearning Aussie dollars; it was seeing boom time thanks to an ever expanding Chinese economy churningthrough Australia’s raw materials.After handing over a copy of my British passport and a copy of my signature I was an official Australianbank account holder. How easy was that? Me, David “the foreigner” Clarke, with no fixed address andbarely a pennie to my name. I had walked into a bank and now held an Australian blank account in myname. Cool, one task down, one to go, or so I thought.There were still 2 tasks if you count the application for a tax file number (TFN). A TFN was the equivalentof a National Insurance Number, a unique identifier that all people working in Australia must have. Howelse would the government distribute the country’s wealth?The accountant at KJRoss & Associates, a guy called Lyndon, had my tax affairs at hand I thought… Hesent me a form to fill in, which I astutely completed and returned detailing my worldly assets (none thatwere of any noticeable worth). Lyndon subsequently sent me an excel spreadsheet that calculated myliving away from home allowance (LAFHA) based on my current financial standing. LAFHA, was a taxbreak for employees sourced from abroad to fill the needs of the Australian work force. Simply speaking, Life Turned Upside Down21 of 156KJRoss would use it as a means to pay for my rent. I remember taking a look at the wage calculationsthat Lyndon had generated. My mathematics aren’t too shabby, but his finance calculations baffled me.When I cannot understand any calculations, I feel belittled. My reaction is one of anger with thoughts ofbeen taken for a ride. ‘F*ck you Lyndon!’ immediately entered my consciousness. My wages accordingto my contract were $100,000 before tax. I thought it was cool earning a six figure salary. Given theexchange rate at the time, AU$1.8 to the £, I was set to earn the highest wage of my life. Given though,the higher price of living in Sydney, Australia, my dollars wouldn’t be stretching as far…Hey, anyway, at least I was going to be earning a wage after a good 2 months of being without. Eventhough I was unsure if what I was earning was correct. I did have spending money to tide me by,AU$1000 to be exact. With the accommodation paid for by the consultancy coffers for the next coupleof weeks, all I really had to financially concern myself with was the cost of food, drink and transport,which was nice.Food was expensive, the Coles or Woolworths supermarkets were the cheapest food outlets. Theproliferous, open 24-hours, 7-11 stung the shopper on prices. The price you pay for convenience.In the U.K. I had developed a taste for Gap “twisted” jeans and protein. The latter was a consequence ofvanity, pursued through the many gym sessions I enjoyed each week. In Australia I naturally hoveredaround the cooked food section of any supermarket. My focus was on deals; the cooked chicken sectionwas large, it always offered discounts. Portions ranged from quarter, half to full. There were the othercuts too: drumsticks, wings and thighs, but rarely available at discount. The ultimate find, a reducedprice half portion of chicken with stuffing. To complement the “dirty bird” I would purchase a saladportion (as a cursory tick in the box to being healthy). There is something that I enjoy, vegans would beappalled, ripping cooked meat off an animal’s carcass using bare hands and teeth. I likened eatingcooked chicken to a game of hide and seek; pieces of cooked flesh, I coming, ready or not! Searching acarcass for any meat hidden away, for me, was a joy of eating.If I had to prioritise the pleasures of eating it would be:1. Presentation2. Flavour3. Texture, including handling foodAustralian cooked chicken was naturally salty. I assumed at the time that salt was added to the bird, theAustralian’s preference. In fact it was a consequence of the chicken’s diet. You are what you eat. Saltytasting chicken is raised on salty foods. The chicken was unusually greasy too, sickeningly so. Thecombined chicken grease and buttery stuffing could cause stomach upsets. The key was to eat slowlyand use plenty of paper towels to mop the grease off the face and surfaces.Australia is where I discovered a love for a number of the more exotic fruits: the avocado and the mangoto name but two. Mangos were in season in November and were on sale. They were messy; the fibreous tissue always got stuck between the teeth. The excessive, viscous juice always rolled down the chinand collected on my t-shirt. It was all worth it; the sweet reward is diffiult to describe. “A tastesensation” is a term I use to describe a flavour that makes me smile. Smiling is something I did often inthis new, bright, “t-shirt, shorts, and mango fruit” environment.

Chapter 4
Same work, different climate
A couple of days had passed, what had I achieved? I had a bank account, but my TFN was still beingprocessed and I needed a mobile phone contract. Apart from those niggly todo items I had nothing toworry about…so I thought.It was another bright and warm day, t-shirt and shorts? Not today, today was to be day one of work. Itwas to be, as it was in the rest of the western white-collar world, suited and booted. Thankfully I cameprepared; the Hugo Boss suit, one my brother picked up for me at Frankfurt airport, was hanging neatlyin the wardrobe. I decided to leave wearing the jacket, a wise move given the humid climate.The Sydney office of KJRA was located in the suburb in North Sydney. Being a rambler, I decided to go onfoot, which meant negotiating the Sydney Harbour Bridge. As I began my walk from the accommodationI could feel the perspiration pour down my back. I was a sweater, but it took a good heat to begin theprocess and only my back was noticeably affected. One thing I never concerned myself with in the U.K.was my hydration levels whilst walking. In Australia I now had to account for new level of humidity.In North Sydney, on entering the high-rise building premises I was met with a friendly face at reception.“K.J.Ross and Associates?”, I asked. “7th floor”, replied the front office staff. On exiting the lift on the 7thfloor I peered at the business name plaques that lay before me. I turned left and noticed the vacantkitchen area that included a “posh coffee” machine. I made a mental note to make use of that later. Itwas easy to locate the K.J.Ross and Associates office. As I opened the door I noticed staplers here,folders there, mountains of laptops somewhere else. It was a bloody mess by all intents and purposes.In the corner of the office appeared a 6 foot plus, well-built man in a suit. My thoughts immediatelywere “This is the guy that Mark told me about”. He failed to contact me on many occasions. This wasgoing to be my first communications with him. “You must be Dave” he said in a quintessential, deep,Australian droll. “Bruce, I’m responsible for Sydney operations”, he extended his hand and I firmly shuckit. “Sorry about the mess” he exclaimed, “we’re in the process of moving.” Bruce’s appearance andmanner conveyed a sense of importance. This disguised his actual role at KJRA, pre-sales i.e. drummingup potential business. Bruce was a scatter-brain, which didn’t lend itself well to the level of changeahead. He tried his best to play host, introduce me into the company mix, sales meetings and thepending office move. First things first as it was in Australian culture, host.Bruce gave me a quick tour of the office and the facilities on the floor. He, importantly, showed me howto operate the coffee machine. The resultant “frothy coffee” was delicious and quenched my thirst. Wereturned to the office and back to the subject of business. Bruce briefed me on client work at a financialinstitute E*Trade, a subsidiary of ANZ, another Southern Hemisphere financial giant. The work wasbasically the same as the work I had done in the UK, test automation.Bruce looked around frantically in his unorganised office for a phone number. He finally managed to findand dial it. After a few rings, Bruce in his deep Aussie accent said “Mark?”. Mark quickly replied “hiBruce”. “I have Dave Clarke here in the office, I’ll put us on speaker phone.” Mark Pedersen elaboratedon the role and questioned my experience. “Dave, you’ve got HP QTP experience?” HP QTP was anindustry standard software tool commonly used at the time. Mark mentioned I should talk to “our man Life Turned Upside Down23 of 156in the field”, a KJRA consultant called Cuong Pham working at ANZ, for even further information on therole. I frantically searched for a pen and piece of paper to note his contact details.The speaker phone call from Mark was ended and a more in-depth, one-to-one call with Cuong wasinitiated. Cuong began with a reference to what the test automation industry called a “keyword drivenframework”. Up until that point I had only heard of that term, but had never used keyword driven testautomation solution. As soon as he mentioned this I got excited, given its potential impact on my futurecareer. The experience would make me even more valuable to the IT industry. I confirmed that I had thenecessary appetite (but maybe not necessarily the experience) to implement Cuong’s automationframework at E*Trade. Thankfully, Cuong mentioned he was happy to offer on-site assistance. Fantastic,I ended the phone call feeling confident, the “man on the field” was only a phone call away. The “gig”wouldn’t happen till the following week given the financial industry’s red tape. I was frustrated, I wantedto start now, it had been a long time since I sniffed any test automation. For now, I had a while to relaxand offer my services to Mr Bruce Rawsthorne.Bruce had an air of importance about him, and a sense of childish fun. His soft, fun side was a welcomecontrast to the façade of importance. I would get to familiarise myself with these 2 sides to Bruce overthe next few days. Bruce was brought in primarily as a salesperson, selling consultant resources, topotential clients. He brought me along to his client meetings, as far as I could gather, to:1. keep him company.2. show off; there was that sense of “watch this, I’m going to sell snow to an Eskimo“.3. add some “software testing meat” to the sales conversation. Bruce thought he knew sales, hedefinitely didn’t know software testing.4. act as a “lamb to the slaughter”. I was an actual available resource, ready to provide a service attheir signing of contract.I had never before, in the years working as a consultant in the UK, experienced a consultancy servicesales meeting. I enjoyed it; what’s not to like:• I didn’t need to say a word if I didn’t want to; Bruce could metaphorically talk the legs off awooden horse.• I got a free frothy coffee, in some cases I would get a free lunch.Well, food that was compliments of the Bruce and the consultancy, as I would find out, wasn’t exactlyfree. When Bruce hung up his business shoes, which varied from day to day given his business meetings,he was happy to head home, to work of course. Being the great guest that he was, and knowing I knewno-one, he would see to it that I should be invited.Bruce’s home was situated in the beautiful suburb of Manly. It is a paradise, just far enough away fromthe city and close enough to unspoilt coast line that it still felt remote. It could be accessed in a roundabout way by road. The best and least stressful way to access Manly was by ferry. There were twoservices that departed from Circular Quay at very regular intervals: fast and regular. The Fast Cat (shortfor catamaran) ferry operated when the water in Sydney harbour was pancake flat. The regular, morerobust standard ferry, would operate whatever the conditions. The heaviest of these could literally turnthe ferry on its side and the stomach inside out. It was a life affirming experience; I often thought aboutkissing the Manly pier in gratitude for being alive on arrival. Life Turned Upside Down24 of 156Bruce was a Fast Cat man; he liked to be seen hanging out with people in the upper echelons of Manlylife. Bruce loved the excesses and deep down wanted to be rich and famous. Maybe his thoughts aboutrubbing shoulders with the rich would rub off on his financial and career aspirations. Bruce was agenerous person, which ran contrary to the financially astute nature of the rich. He liked to see it that Iwas paid for, and that he was reimbursed for his troubles by the consultancy. Before I had the chance toget cash out of my wallet, Bruce stepped in. “Dave, don’t worry mate, I’ve got this” he confidentlyannounced as went about purchasing a travel ticket at the vacant ticket machine.Bruce handed me a credit card sized piece of card and led me to the back of a short queue. After the hoyballoy arriving passengers got their diamond encrusted shoes onto dry land, we the departingreplacements were allowed on board. The two decks had ample space, the upper was fuller, and filledwith suited and booted business men. This behaviour is common in the animal kingdom e.g., a malehowler monkey announces his presence to other groups by getting to the top of the tallest tree andbellowing. The bellowing on the Fast Cat was influenced by pre-boarding cans of alcohol, purchasedfrom the circular quay terminal convenience stores. Bruce was no exception, he has bought a bag loadof “Bundy” (Bundaberg) and coke mixer cans. Bundaberg, a region in Queensland, Australia, was thenamesake of the famous Aussie rum, which was surprisingly, and dangerously, tasty.Given Bruce’s regular showing on board, he recognised a number of people, but wasn’t on aconversational level with them. Instead he said “hi” and passed by. His calm demeanour soon turnedinto a rushed 2-step as he noticed someone on the top-deck. Bruce yelled “Doug!” Doug was unaware ofhis good friend’s presence and continued to look on. Bruce’s 2-step turned into a tango as he rushed on,dragging me with him, to get to the top deck. “Doug, there you are. Why the f*ck didn’t you turn aroundwhen I shouted” Bruce said in a nettled tone. “Dave, this is Doug, Doug, this is Dave.” Doug, a NewZealander was Like most of the kiwis I was to meet, they were well built. Doug was no exception, he wasa good six feet tall, had little in the way of hair, Mediterranean complexion and built like a human tank.He was closer to my age than Bruce’s. He gave an air of confidence: shoulders were firmly back, his suitwas immaculate and his sunglasses were rimmed with gold. Doug worked as a consultant at theCommonwealth Bank; he bragged about the bad situation the company was in. Doug knew Bruce fromtime back when they were flat mates. Bruce’s behaviour changed around Doug. The business façadethat Bruce tried to put on from 9-till-5 was replaced with a sniggering, droll demeanour. The two ofthem were like a scripted double act. Bruce would, with perfect timing, contributed to Doug’sscandalous stories. The conversation between Doug and Bruce moved onto “the buddies”, a group ofdrinking buddies they met up with each week. The person at the centre of the chat was Glenn and hisgirlfriend Andi. I was to find out soon that these two people would become a bigger part of my life overthe coming weeks.On reaching Sydney Harbour we disembarked and made our way to the Bavarian Beer Café, a chain ofGerman themed bars that adorned Sydney. I felt like a 5th wheel in the conversation as Doug and Brucecontinued to chat about work and engross themselves in their past glories. I was less mesmerised by theconversation and more by the manner in which he handled his beer glass. I could sense by the wayBruce was a seasoned drinker. The schooner was an extension of his body language as he lavished in theforetelling of his extravagant life moments. Beer was social lubrication for Bruce; he definitely unwound,pouring insights into his pre-marriage life. I could tell from the details of his stories that he still wantedto be one of the lads. It was apparent from his stories of old that Bruce had led a diverse life. Life Turned Upside Down25 of 156Bruce, at some point in his life, had lived over in America for a short period of time as a skiing instructor.Supposedly this was something that a lot of Australians that had finished their University studies did. Inever asked him how and why Australians did this? ‘Where did Aussies learn to ski?’ It was a subject forthe Google search engine. He was also Doug’s old flat mate and pre-marriage wingman. The pad theyhad, in days gone by, rented in Manly could only be described as a shagging stable, or so it wasportrayed. These stories, especially after a few steins, could easily be embellished. Bruce had worked asa promoter too, working for a company that takes clients out on Party Boats around Sydney Harbour.The parties, according to his stories, got a little too loud for the authorities and were often cut short.Bruce told a story that every English person would love to hear, which made me chuckle, a story aboutan ex-girlfriend of his. He mentioned her name, Sheila. The conclusion of the story was “I had to leaveher after realising that if we married, the bride and groom to be would have been Bruce and Sheila!”Bruce had been married twice. His first marriage was one more out of jouvenile pleasure, instead of along-term commitment. He and his wife regretfully had to end that commitment early. His current wife,Tiffany, or Tiff as she was known to the masses, was heavily pregnant with Bruce's son to be. She was anamazing lady, a personality akin to a rising sun: She was full of warmth, energy and enthusiasm. Thelatter was something definitely lacking in my personality.The sun was slowly setting. Doug was finishing his second drink, a Bundy and Coke. He looked down atthe large, ornate time piece on his wrist and opened his eyes widely to show a surprised expression. Heplaced his empty glass down, raised his sunnies and embraced Bruce. Joyfully he exhaled “See you bro,got to get home to the wifey.” He released the embrace and shook my hand firmly. He returned hissunnies to his nose and adjusted his man bag around his plush, lightly coloured, unfettered suit. Brucechecked his watch and mentioned that Glenn was going to be arriving soon. Bruce cast an eye towardsthe sea-ward horizon. “Dave have a look at that” he said, indicating I should join him looking out to seaas the sun set. With an Aussie droll that felt like it lasted minutes, he said “Isn’t it beeeeee-youuuuu-tiful!” There was definitely more to Bruce than his laddish exploits had me believe. I could sense he lovedthe outdoor life, and was in touch with the Australian coastal landscape.Glenn eventually materialised; he was another “fast-ferry-goer” with an image to match. Glenn wasterser than any other Aussie I had met thus far. He was one of the most complex characters I had met sofar too. He wasn’t the open, approachable type; My fly on the wall existence became swatted as hechatted to Bruce. He didn’t stay for long, he had little reason to, given he didn’t drink. Closer to the truthit was more about his girlfriend Andy, she didn’t allow him to drink. Bruce talked about Glenn as a DrJekyl and Mr Hyde type of character. His Mr Hyde, also known as Stifler (from American Pie moviefame), reared its ugly head after he consumed copious amounts of alcohol. I wondered if Glenn was analcoholic. Anyway, Andy kept the boozy Mr Hyde in check. She knew just how destructive drink was toGlenn’s health and their relationship.Soon after Glenn left for home, Bruce made his excuses, turned on his business personality and replayedDoug’s “surprise and check watch” body language. Anyway, it was a good time to be heading back to themainland, the last ferry out of Manly to Circular Quay was moments away from departing.The next morning, I got into the North Sydney office later than expected. I could see Bruce in his office.He looked preoccupied with his laptop, which he duly closed and quickly hobbled towards me. I nevernoticed the hobble before; Bruce winced and said “bloody leg, I should get it looked at. Right, I’m latefor a sales meeting. See you ladies later.” As he continued to rushedly hobble past, he said that Elliot, his Life Turned Upside Down26 of 156second in command, would be arriving at the office soon. I took the company laptop out of the K.J.Rossbranded backpack, made some space on the dishevelled table and fired up a web browser.There was still much for me to organise. One thing on my mind, which should have bothered me moregiven I was nearing my first week at the work digs, was my living arrangements. Only a week remaineduntil I would need to find a new place to live. In the UK I had never rented, or house shared. I had themindset of living on my own and paying a mortgage. Renting was going to be a big change.Unfortunately, finding a place to rent near Sydney CBD was difficult. In addition, finding affordablehousing for a Joe on Software Testers wages was next to impossible. Looking at the estate agent websites, my hopes were rightfully dashed. Many people I spoke to in Sydney said I should investigate houseshares. I am a stubborn sole; It was either find a place to rent by myself in Manly or nothing! WhyManly? To quote Bruce, Manly was “Beeeeee-youuuuuu-ti-ful”.Elliot materialised, popping his head in and saying hello. Elliot was a lanky, baby face, looking more like a20 something than a mid-thirty something. He had an expression of joy that lit up the room. His eyesportrayed intensity that contrasted his kind smile. Elliot extended his hand, which I shook firmly “youmust be Dave, Bruce mentioned you’d be in the office. Elliot Caldwell, I’m working alongside Bruce todrum up business here in Sydney. Not long now until the E*Trade gig” he clucked. “Yep, we’ve got yousigned up for an initial 2 weeks of POC (proof of concept) work.” “That will definitely be extended.”“With Cuong’s support we’ll get the ANZ test automation framework ported over as quick as.” Elliotasked if I’d had a coffee… “No” I merrily replied. “Right, I just need to read a few emails. We should headto a coffee shop round the corner where they sell proper coffees.”Elliot loved his “frothy coffees”, a term in my lexicon that would soon be replaced with the term “propercoffees”. Elliot’s taste in coffees were over the top: multi-shot Espresso-based drinks with at least a pintof steamed milk. He sourced his caffeine hit from a local café, at most, two blocks away from the office. Iwas fresh faced to the coffee scene, having not embraced the infantile industry in the UK. Having nowspent time with Bruce and Elliot, coffee appeared to be an integral part of the day-time social culture.Drinking the dark nectar was an acceptable excuse, much like going out for a cigarette, to have a chinwag. Elliot was a master in the art of the looking busy yet getting away with doing nothing. His voiceprojection, tone, pace and vocal variety was textbook. Whatever he said was impactful. As we satoutside the conveniently located café, Elliot puffing away on his B&H, he did not hold back telling his lifestory. The significant events he mentioned in his life were his divorce, his 2 young daughters (5 and 7years old) and his English born mother.I could tell he was fond of English people by his constant sledging of them. I felt that he trusted me,given his venerable willingness to be open about his life. I felt that just being in people’s presence,lending an ear, I could gain their trust. Given how outspoken each Australian had been thus far, it wasn’tdifficult to use my listening skills. It was a role reversal for me; at home around my friends, it was mewho was then outspoken one… It made me realise, by comparison, how unselfish and willing my friendswere to listen.The E*Trade building was like many in Sydney CBD, a modern skyscraper. The ground floor shared itsspace with shops and eateries; the latter was business focussed and dedicated to a range of mostlyAsian tastes. When the weekend came around these food retail spaces were like ghost towns. Life Turned Upside Down27 of 156I, as I normally did at all new client sites, headed over to the reception and asked for my representative.The security guard picked up the phone, chatted with someone and acknowledged that the person wason their way. I proceeded to sit and wait; dressed to impress, I wore a Hugo Boss suit my brother boughtme from its design homeland of Germany. My Ted Baker pinstripe shirt hailed from New Street,Birmingham. I donned an equally elaborate tie combo that glistened when the angle of the lighting wasperfect. The fashionable combo, given the hot, moist Sydney conditions, was a little uncomfortable towear, but fine for the air-conditioned confines of the modern office building.My representative, Srikanth, finally arrived. He appeared timid, lacking eye contact; his heavily Indianaccented mumble projected towards the floor. The rotund, moustached man of Indian descent wasclearly stressed; I was aware that I was an encumbrance on his working day. As he approached, I didwhat was engrained in me in the matters of social protocol: I tried to look him straight in the eyes, smileand offer my hand to cordially shake his. Given I couldn’t get eye contact, I didn’t bother proceeding.Srikanth directed me to security, where I was handed a temporary pass before being escorted to themain lift. As we entered, Srikanth swiped his pass and pressed the button corresponding to our floor. Hesheepishly asked me “how are you?” I could sense his social discomfort; a far cry from the more laidback general Aussie question “How ya going?” In both cases a simple “good” would have sufficed, but Ican at times take a question and run with the answer if I felt in the mood. The instance that Srikanthasked, that’s exactly what I did, to his bemusement. I took this rare opportunity to voice my opinion. TheAussies I had met thus far, mainly Bruce and Elliot, left little room for me to talk. I literally talkedSrikanth’s ears off as the lift ascended and approached our floor.As the lift doors parted I could sense Srikanth’s relief, this and the huge E*Trade sign that stood beforeme. He chaperoned me across the E\*Trade floor space and over to the desk of a European looking bloke.Before he opened his mouth, I could tell from his body language and his dress sense that he was anEnglishman. He swivelled his seat round, looked up at Srikanth and then at me. Srikanth beamed asDaniel, the level-headed English fellow, stood up slowly and offered a hand shake. “You must be fromK.J.Ross and Associates” he exclaimed as he drew another slurpy breath. “Do you have everything youneed?” Srikanth asked Daniel. “Yep, I’ve got the test automation software download available on a sharethat I should be able to access from any PC connected to the network.” Like a flash he was out of hisseat with a keen eye on getting the most of me. I followed Daniel to a cubicle with 4 Windows PCs and aApple Mac. This area was the “multi-platform rig” the team used as the final quality check before givingit the green light for promotion into production. It was now going to be polluted with my testautomation software set for installation on each Window’s PC.Daniel booted up the first PC and jokingly positioned himself such that he shielded his presence while hetapped in the administrator username and password on the login screen. As the windows desktopappeared it was then time to search for the installation files. Daniel slowly and delicately tapped in thepath to the directory, his eyes moving erratically from paper to keyboard to screen. He hit the Enter keywith a great deal of force to signify task completion. He looked up at the PC monitor and located the filehe was looking for, much to his elation. He double clicked on said file, which prompted an error. A sighof frustration exited his braced teeth. “What’s then issue now?” he trumped. Breathing out heavily hehesitantly moved his eyes away from the screen and back to his piece of paper. “Right, wait here, I’ll beback soon. I just need to email IT Security to resolve this.” Life Turned Upside Down28 of 156IT Security were in no way thugs in uniform, like many security guards, which was the case for IT SecurityOfficer John. They were tough though, tough on all things IT Security. If you wanted to copy a file froman external USB drive, John would be ready to come down on you like a proverbial ton of bricks. WhenDaniel asked John if he could update the privileges of the admin account to permit installation ofsoftware, John frowned. “Sorry Daniel I can’t do that”, he said in an Anglicised Australian accent. Hecontinued, “but I can install the file for you using my elevated privileges.” He tapped a few keys and lowand behold the install sprung into life. The first prompt appeared on the screen, which made John feeledgy. “What should I select here?” He read the options aloud. Daniel looked at me for direction. Iinstalled some confidence in them both by quickly replying with the required option. The next promptappeared, Daniel looked at me again, I again promptly advised. After a few more prompts the screenwas ablaze with progress bar activity.The three of us stood there like the 3 amigos, arms crossed, waiting. Daniel was the first to break thesilence as he quizzed John with a tone indicating an element of foolhardiness and comical wit. “So, John,how’s the security team?” John’s eyes didn’t leave the screen as he answered in a quick-fire mannerthat was enthusiastic yet reserved. “Well, we’re getting version control installed on all the machines inthe coming weeks”, he clucked. “Full roll out is planned to be completed by years end” he exclaimed. Icould sense Daniel wasn’t too bothered about the answer. Asking a question for question’s sake. “How’sthe family?” Daniel continued. “Good” John continued, “Mother just got back from surgery last week,she’s doing well.” John was quick to point out that his mother was English, which explained theAnglicised accent.“Right, it looks like the installation has finished. Do you need any further assistance?”, affirmed John.Daniel smiled, gently nodded with a closed mouth “no”, he said. Daniel, graciously and jokingly, thankedJohn for his help as the login screen appeared once again. As John trundled off, Daniel logged back inand launched the freshly installed test automation software. “Over to you Dave” he indicated. I asked afew questions about the application under test before selecting the correct options and continuing. Idemonstrated the automation software was working as expected. Daniel smiled, “Right, the next thingwe need to do is get Cuong’s framework setup and we should be away.” “That should be enough fortoday; we’ll reconvene tomorrow.”

## Chapter 5

### Vagabond

The next couple of weeks were a blur. In drinking and socialising terms, yeah, a lot happened. I wasseeing Bruce, Elliot and people at E*Trade on a regular basis. Bruce, in Manly, Elliot, out west inAnnadale and E*Trade, smack bang in the CBD. One thing that I hoped, but didn’t effortfully procure,was a new rental property. My tenure at the consultancy accommodation had come to an end; I was leftto fend for myself in temporary accommodation located in the Sydney concrete jungle. It was anunnerving, comfort zone pushing experience having to move from pillar-to-post each day. Packing,unpacking my suitcases and backpack, I got by (in the loosest sense). One day it was hostelaccommodation in the CBD, the next it was a temporary house share in Manly. Much can be said abouthaving a place that you call home. From day-to-day it’s difficult enough dealing with the stresses of anew workplace. Having to adjust the daily routine for each place of temporary accommodation was onemore thing I could do without. What was worse, I was booking the cheapest single roomaccommodation I could find at the last minute. Accordingly, there was little availability and high prices.For my sanity and wallet, I couldn’t afford to do this indefinitely.The move was on, not just for me, but the entire Sydney based KJRA team. The A-Team, consisting ofme, Bruce and Elliot, saw fit to load up Elliot’s Tardis like Holden Carlton with the contents of the NorthSydney office. Amazingly, it only took 3 trips to clear all the contents of the “old” North Sydneypremises. The new, compact, centrally located Circular Quay Office was packed to the rafters with, to beblunt, crap! The number of KJRA training manuals available to the Sydneysiders had reached epicproportions. This material, equal in professional quality content to that of the international standard,was unheard of outside Australia… This was purely down to lack of marketing. Mark had told me thestory; it could have been the global software testing standard, but another body was faster to market itsmaterial.K.J.Ross and Associates, as I was to find out, had an interesting history. It was created by one man, ahumble doctorate in Computer Science, Dr. Kelvin Ross. He had the brilliant idea of shepherding some ofthe academic community at Queensland University (his back yard). These academics, with a softwareengineering background, would become his software testing consultants. Some would focus teachingsoftware testing theory whilst others would provide businesses a resource to implement the theory. Theresult, a consultancy of rolls-royce resources, executing their work to the highest of industry’s standards.They were loyal to the cause, Kelvin and his consultancy, but lacked direction. Kelvin, the owner, comingfrom the background of academia, wasn't business savvy. This was where Mark came in; He was giventhe title of Chief Operating Officer (COO), to fuel a direction. Mark had one plan in mind, copy the goalto success that aided the rise and takeover of Cresta, the first testing consultancy I worked for. Markwas viewed as one of the men behind Cresta’s success.Why then did the likes of Elliot and Bruce work for K.J.Ross & Associates. Their backgrounds didn’t fitwith the rest of the business. One trait they exuded by the bucketload was the propensity to bullshit.Mark was well and truly wrapped around, in the case of Elliot, his cigarette-stained, little finger. The artof bullshitting, and it truly is an art, had got them a foot in the door at K.J.Ross & Associates Officeventure in Sydney. So far it was going smoothly, Bruce was the logistics captain, having chosen the newCircular Quay office premises. He assigned himself the position of Sydney office boss. It’s a shame he Life Turned Upside Down30 of 156was a glorified salesman, and to call him a salesman would be an insult to the job title. By definition, asalesman sells stuff. I had witnessed Bruce’s sales prowess first-hand. Let it be said, the man would havedifficulty selling Thylacines (the extinct Tasmanian Tigers) to Tasmania.“Mr Playford”, those words should be enunciated with a deep, smooth UK radio presenters’ tone, wasthe next KJRoss newbie to be installed in the Sydney office. Dave, was a Canadian man in his forties, witha hew to his face that said much about his drinking habits. The finely groomed, minge-beared man was amouth of soft mumbles. He was, by Canadian standards, a quiet bloke. The intense, wide-eyed staregave an indication of his focus. He wasn’t focussed purely on the work that he had to complete, he wasconcerned with the focus applied to keeping his head in the realms of reality. Unfortunately, he sufferedfrom shades of Asperger’s, which made him a little less sociable, but allowed him to plow throughtechnical solutions.Contracts pertaining to the delivery of test automation at E\*Trade were still in the process of beingwritten up. While in the new K.J.Ross Sydney office, Dave Playford, Elliot and I ran through coursematerial. With Elliot as the assigned teacher, what that man couldn’t apply himself to could be writtenon the back of a postage stamp, and Bruce out selling business, we had lots of bench time. Bench timewas what any consultancy feared, a time when resources earned no money for the business. Truth betold, we covered lots of course material and obtained lots of certificates, showing just how much ofK.J.Ross’s money we had burnt.During my time in the K.J.Ross office, I would consistently head in around 9am. Dave would turn up alittle later because of the almighty 2-hour journey he had to endure. Elliot and Bruce would roll in as andwhen. Working from home was always an option for Elliot and Bruce. Their relationship was aninteresting one. They didn’t always see eye-to-eye and often bitched about each other behind eachother’s backs. The issues they had were many: machismo, power mongering and who had the bettersales technique. Mark talked about the old Sydney team before his arrival. In Sydney, K.J.Ross was a twomen strong team: Joel Deutcher, a performance test specialist working at Commonwealth Bank andElliot Caldwell, the “lend his hand to anything” specialist, which included sales, but he also did well as aclient liaisons manager. Mark saw fit to hire a new salesman, Bruce, and let Elliot focus on makingmoney for the business by working on client site. As with any major change, especially one around roles,Bruce’s arrival had flustered the sure-footed Elliot. Elliot, when not working for the client, continued tofollow up on leads and answer any of K.J.Ross’s Sydney office phone queries. Both Bruce and Elliot wereoptimistic to the point of constantly bullshitting. Whilst talking to the duo, I often acted out in my headbreathing in heavily through gapingly wide nostrils to indicate a wiff of a bad smell. There was theadage, especially from Elliot, that we didn’t have enough members of staff to fill the abundant roles thatcompanies were throwing our way. The leads we had “pouring in” were few and far between.

## Chapter 6

### Another Day in Paradise

Everyone I had met so far were accommodating, Bruce was by far the most generous. Knowing I washaving grief finding a place to stay he got me in touch with his drinking buddy, Glenn, who wanted tomeet me first. So, one lunch time, on a hot summer's day in Sydney CBD, I walked into a pub. I justabout noticed Glenn; he was sat in a booth, suited and booted, next to an equally dapper lookingcolleague. Glenn stood up, gave me an unwavering, expressionless look and shook my hand. Theexpression on my face suddenly changed, from one of a relaxed, whimsical joy, to one of fear. Thefeeling of formality was eerily like an interview. Glenn looked me up and down like a notice on a parkingmeter and went in like a vulture into a fresh carcass. “What is your name?” “Where are you from?”“What year is it?” “Who is the Prime Minister?” (the last two questions were made up by me, sorry). Hisstare didn’t leave my gaze; I could not to look away, he probably would have killed me if I did.The questioning continued; the intensity of the questioning abated somewhat after a few minutes. Isensed he was satisfied with my answers up until that point. Glenns spiel trajectory changed fromquestioning to statements; he began stating the apartment rules. It was like listening to the laws of FightClub (a film starring Bradd Pitt and Edward Norton). Just like the rules of fight club, I thought he wasgoing to apply the same slant to the apartment I.e., the first rule of the apartment is... there is noapartment. He didn’t, much to my dismay. He mentioned I could stay at the apartment from next week.The last day of the stay would be up until one week before Christmas. Everything was verbally agreed,nothing to sign, sweet. That would give me three weeks to search for a new apartment. Plenty of time?The second week of December came along. I was all smiles, having spent a few weeks living in cheapinner city hostels I was looking forward to some stability on the home front. One early evening I mademy way to Glenn’s apartment over in Queenscliff, Sydney. I was baking hot, walking along the side-walkof Manly Beach thanks to my long British style winter jacket. It was an effort walking up the hill to reachthe ground floor of the apartment. I looked at the text he sent me; Keys are located under the front sidewheel of the pick-up truck. That sounded straightforward enough, there was only one pickup on thedrive. I took a “man look” under the front side passenger wheel, nothing… Maybe Glenn meant theother passenger wheel, nothing. I took a look under the whole car and saw nothing. Bugger! Where thehell were the keys? I thought of my below par searching efforts, “let’s have a proper feel” were my nextthoughts. I ran my hand thoroughly around the passenger side wheel. Yep, they must have been slightlyout of reach previously as the jingle-jangle sound joyously sung to my ears. Like a “level-up” scene out ofvideo game I held the keys aloft. I approached the tiny lift on the ground floor and hit the call button. Asthe sardine can of a lift opened, I was happy to see no one inside. “Now, where is the button to floor 3” Isaid out loud.The lift door opened, a plushily carpeted landing led to the door of many apartments. The door in frontwas white, modern and inviting. I tried the keys, a turn to the left confirmed a success with a unresistedclunk! I nodded my head affirmatively; my head and eyes swept the space that lay before me. I wasamazed at the size, and thanks to huge windows, brightness that filled the interior. The centre piece ofthe apartment was a 50” flat screen TV placed the perfect distance from the sofa. My heart raced in theknowledge that I would one day get to indulge in this audio-visual showpiece. My phone pinged,indicating a text; It read “I hope you found your way into the apartment. Andy is on her way, she’ll behappy to show you round. Glenn” I tentatively perched my bottom on the edge of the sofa and Life Turned Upside Down32 of 156proceeded to melt into the core of the cushions. The thought “could life be any better than this momentright now?” circled in my head like birds of prey soaring in the updraft.Andy opened the door, shopping bags in hand, she directed a “hey” my way before beckoning the catsto the kitchen. Andy had presence; she was a good 5’9” without her heels, a New Zealander, tanned,toned, with piercing blue eyes. Her presence was very inviting on the eyes for that matter. After puttingfood items into the fridge and seeing to dishing out the cats’ dinner she turned her attentions towardsme. “David is it? Hi, I’m Andy, Glenn’s partner.” “I’m not sure if Glenn has showed you round the place? Iguess not with it being your first day at the apartment.” Andy began with showing me the kitchen, thelounge, the extensive balcony that ran around the perimeter and finally the spare bedroom. Thebedroom was enormous and included an en suite. I plonked my belongings down and continuedfollowing Andy back to the kitchen where she offered me an Aussie brew labelled VB. I didn’t hesitate, Iwas parched. The bottle of beer was screw top and handed to me in a neoprene beer bottle blanket theAussies call stubby holder. Aussies laughed about the British and their warm beer culture. Australiansprided themselves on drinking ice cold beer, especially from a stubby (bottle).Andy began talking about the finer details of the new living arrangements, “Dave you need to”:1. “...be quiet if arriving back to the apartment late at night.”2. “...keep the apartment clean at all times.”3. “...keep this door closed because the cats could get out and injure themselves.”4. “...pay rent the equivalent of $300 (£150) per week.”The cost of rental was quite expensive, as rental agreements go, but heaps cheaper than staying athotels. I looked outside and admired the horizon; the bright lights of Manly reflecting off the liquorice oflightly lapping sea. I took a final sip of the refreshing Australian beer and made my way into the lounge.My first night in the Queenscliff apartment was restful bliss. My eyes opened at the crack of dawn as thefirst beams of the sunlight’s orangey rays enveloped the bedroom. In a light sleep I pictured anorchestra of angels playing harp; that soft, angelic sound faded before a melodic drum beat kicked in.Phil Collins “Another Day In Paradise” began to play and my sate of being elevated to 11 on the SpinalTap scale. I opened my eyes and gazed at the glass window of my balcony door. Like a scene frompoltergeist, my body levitated and moved towards the light, out onto the balcony. I looked to my rightand noticed a plethora of outdoor essentials including: A BBQ & well-worn wet suits. The airtemperature was already 20 Degrees C, with a cool breeze sauntering off Queenscliff Beach. I walked tothe corner of the balcony, posturing for the best view of the beach below. The beach was packed; eventhough it was the weekend the kids were being schooled, exchanging their books for life saver activities.There was a wet suited colony of surfers out in a spot in the ocean off Queenscliff Beach waiting to catchthe next wave in. I looked further into the distance and admired the sun glow behind the decadentShelley Beach. I took a deep breath, the salty sea air tingled at the back of my nostrils. ‘Could life get anybetter than this moment right now?’ I thought yet again. I headed slowly back inside to the lounge. Thehuge TV seemed to stare at me blankly as I visited the kitchen. I took out a box of Weetbix, a cereal I hadrecently discovered in the local Coles store, and tentatively thought about sampling it. Weetbix was notsimply a misspelt Weet-a-bix (the British branded) copy. Weetbix had a greater depth of wheat-likeflavour. It was larger and crumblier in texture; an Australia's taste sensation. Life Turned Upside Down33 of 156Talking of taste sensations there were many that Australia offered. I didn’t know it at the time, but itwas mango season. Fresh mango flavoured produce was cheap, given high supply from neighbouringstate Queensland. The soft, yellow, ridiculously sweet, fibrous fruit tasted delectable. The other fruithigh on the flavour stakes was the beautiful watermelon and the dragon fruit, also grown in tropicalQueensland. Tropical fruit grown locally tasted much sweeter than the imported UK supermarketequivalent I was used to.Coffee, was always beautiful, prepared to a high standard in every café and sourced, in some casesfrom, you guessed it, a farm in Queensland. A type of cuisine that was spawning a new type ofrestaurant was the gourmet burger. Manly, arguably had the best Gourmet Burger joint in the world,Benbry Burger. Round the corner was a New Zealand burger joint; it offered a different slant on theburger offering. Benbry Burger was by far better value for money. It was often packed to the rafters withcustomers most nights with “wallet watchers” from the nearby hostel. Who could blame their meagremoney stretching. For under AU$10 you set a succulent, aussie-fied example of a premium beef patte(which meant it contained avocado) and a sample of fries. For a smidgeon more you can upsize and adda drink, increasing the cost to \$10.It wasn’t all about American style food in Manly. The British had established their mark on Aussie cultureat its inception as a European extended state. Fish and chip shops were everywhere; most were run by“Asians” (a term the Aussies applied to anyone of far eastern decent). The layout was familiar to any fishand chip emporium purveyor. The main difference between it and its British cousin were the fishchoices. Fancy some shark or red snapper? They were ever so slightly different from cod, haddock andplaice offerings from home. I had to admit it, the fish in Australia tasted better, but their chips werecrap…Another culinary offering that hit the hearty was the pie. The Corso Bake House in Manly kept its doorsopened late. Service was very fast; pies literally flew out the ovens and into the bellies of welcomingcustomers within seconds of ordering. Given the high turnover, as a punter you had to be careful not todevour the delicious compact meal too quickly. This was especially true when the pie contained a highvolume of sauce. In this instance it was a good idea to either wait 30 minutes or have a fire extinguisherto hand! My menu favourites were the curried chicken and the beef and mushroom. All served, as wastradition in Australia, a sachet of tomato ketchup. Beautiful!Back to life and back to a beautiful morning in Manly. I was relieved to see Bruce call round with a sparewetsuit. I wasn’t going to explore Manly to Shelley Beach cove in sub 20 degree C temperatures withoutone! Thankfully I had snorkelling equipment in my luggage, a purchase made during my PADI ScubaDiving course in the East Midlands.In the corner of Manly Beach there was a calm spot where Bruce and I donned our snorkelling appareland walked our way out to deeper water. Bruce went off ahead and I followed. He didn’t wear fins, itagitated his leg, which was giving him jip of late. For a bloke that wasn’t wearing fins, he skimmed acrossthe water like a stone. I found it difficult to keep up with him even with the aid of fins.The water appeared murky; it often did after a night of rainy conditions. I had to get my head out of thewater to catch a glimpse of Bruce and his current position. I was soon getting into clearer waters; theshelves of the rocky seabed could now clearly be seen in the depths below. The underwater worldappeared tranquil and beautiful. Schools of fish majestically moved in unison against the ebb and flow of Life Turned Upside Down34 of 156the sea current. The larger fish hid themselves from view under the shelves within the rocky reef. Brucedove down to inspect the underside of a rocky lip. I, with a sense of trepidation, took a deep breaththrough the snorkel and began a descent to see what more the underwater world offered. Not havingdove so rapidly in prior sea swims, it came as a surprise to me how quickly the fluid pressure changed.My ears were the first sensory apparatus to feel the effects. This was quickly followed by my nose, theforce of the goggles on my face was very uncomfortable. When I eventually surfaced, I realised my nosewas bleeding. It didn’t take much to cause a bloody nose. Unfortunately, I suffered from weakenedblood vessels as a result of habitual nose picking.Bruce indicated heading back to the safety of Manly Beach shore. Off he blasted in a froth of sea foamleaving me for dead. When I eventually reached shore; I could see Bruce effortfully take off his wet suit.Thank goodness he was around to assist me; I forgot just how difficult it was to get out of this essentialwears! Bruce highlighted what he saw in the water. On his list was a turtle, a shark and a giant cuttlefish.None of these I saw. I did see a parrotfish which, by Bruce’s reckoning, are ten to the dozen. For anEnglishman used to seeing greyer lake fish like roach, perch and pike, a parrotfish was something of aneye-opener. On reflection, the whole experience felt like I had switched from the UK’s black and whitestandard definition TV viewing experience to a one that was HD colour. The clarity and temperature ofthe water does wonders to the whole snorkelling experience.

## Chapter 7

### Lady of My Life

It was the approach to Christmas. Apart from applying good old-fashioned elbow grease on client sites,what other excessive work activities happen around that time of year? ...Work parties; the Christmasparty, wherever I worked, topped the excess list. This year the KJR Christmas Party was to be held inearly December. What I loved most about Christmas parties was their potential for unplanned activities.Simply stated, the path of a Christmas Party is controlled by 2 factors, money & ambition. Mark, the guywho hired me, made the special trip to Sydney from his home in Brisbane for such a prestigiousoccasion. It was to be his and my first Christmas Party. Mark had access to the company’s expense kittymeaning money wasn’t going to be the limiting factor. How ambitious were our intentions going to be?Is that a fridge full of beer in the office?Having never experienced an Australian Christmas I did not know what the protocol was. Bruce was onhand to ensure the Aussie experience was loosely adhered to. It would mean taking a trip from the workoffice to the Sydney Fish Market early on Friday afternoon. Why? An Australian Christmas would not bewithout prawns, lemons and Moreton Bay Bugs (a species of lobster). Sydney Fish Market was abuzzwith activity; just like my recent snorkelling experience, I was amazed by the varieties of sea food onoffer. The size of the sea creatures amazed me most.; the prawns were huge! Bruce knew which stall tohead to. He didn’t take long to grab the attention of the fishmonger and land a huge order. With anochre “here-ya”, the aromatic bags of seafood were passed from Bruce to me.The next stop was the bottle-o I.e., the off licence, to ensure the bevvies in the office’s beer fridgeweren’t going to run out this side of Christmas. It was good I popped along; I was given leeway to choosewhichever beers I so desired. Bruce was a huge admirer of the European Becks bottled beer, notpredominantly for its taste, but for the image of class. I on the other had was an admirer of the Aussiebeers that tried their best to imitate the English beers of old. Old dark beers were my tipple of choice,and none came better than a brace of beverage beauties, Tooheys Old and Coppers Stout. I asked Bruceto grab several of both, forgetting that the rest of the staff were likely not to touch these far-right beers.With a fully stocked car of plastic bags, bevvies and prawns we headed back to the office.While Bruce and I were stocking away the bottled beers in the fridge Mark appeared with his weekendwheeled case. His upright, weighty, yet nimble stance gave an air of importance to his appearance. “Higuys, Bruce, did you look into those new opportunities?” he quipped. Bruce blatantly ignored Mark’squestion, choosing to distract himself with a relatively cold Becks that were soon to be refrigerated.Bruce ensured the seafood was easy to access and kept chilled by placing them into the Eskey (cool box).We immediately got stuck into the jumbo prawns. Mark saw me struggling with my peeling techniqueand offered his assistance. He asked me to watch, it took him literally seconds to peel and consume. “It’sall in the snapping of the head” he said. It is a coordinated action that is beautiful to behold. I watchedwith awe and tried unsuccessfully to imitate the technique. It didn’t stop us getting through a heft of theshelled critters.Soon the bins were filling up; the aroma of spilt beer and prawn digestive sacks was filling the office air.Admittedly, it did not bother us enough to leave the premises. Bruce, forever the awesome host,proposed we participate in a bit of gambling to while away the wee drinking hours. He suggested weplay some club tunes to get us in the mood, post office drinking. Dave Playford admirably volunteered to Life Turned Upside Down36 of 156play DJ; he hooked up the company laptop to the network and fired off tracks on Pandora, a free musicstreaming service. The party was just kicking off when Elliot and Joel entered the office. Elliot, foreversmiling, lit up the room and introduced us all to the relatively old hand Joel. Bruce’s grin widened as hesaw new punters to rope in on a game of Texas Holdem rules Poker. Bruce wanted to play for money,Mark refused, instead suggesting we play for sweets. We drank more, ate more, bet more and I won!We were in the mood to hit the town and leave the stench of prawn and beers behind. We called intovarious bars in and around Circular Quay, including a German themed bar that served some of the finestdark beer I have ever tasted, Hofbrau Dunkel.With the night beginning to turn up and our body coordination turning down, we ended up swaying overto Sydney’s top midnight club venue, The Argyle. I couldn’t believe I made it past the bouncers withoutstacking it; focus was key. The venue was dark, brash and loud, memories of the night becamesnapshots of which the following were forever enamoured:• The bar area where Bruce, Mark, Joel and I drank at.• Being left in Bruce’s company.• Bruce and I speaking to 2 Aussie girls, managing somehow to get one of the girls to enter herphone number in my new-fangled Apple iPhone 3G.• Some woman stealing my hat that I somehow procured from some other random person.• Taking a piss in the unusual men’s room where the urinals were, from one particular angle, inview of the whole club!• Happily eating a Macca’s (MacDonalds) chicken burger and slurping down a strawberrymilkshake.• Half-arsedly opening the door to Queenscliff Apartment and thankfully locating my bedroom.I somehow had the foresight, prior to the night out, to set my alarm for 9am. The default iPhone alarmring tone rang. As I rose from my slumber, I scrambled to locate my phone. I hit the stop buttonimmediately before returning to the land of nod. 30 minutes passed before the phone sounded again.This time round the sound was different, it wasn’t the alarm, it was someone trying to voice call me. Iconfusedly reached for the handset and accepted the call. With a “rough as arse holes” voice I said“hello.” “Is this David Clarke? We’re all here waiting for ya.” a cool Aussie voice announced. My halfcooked brain took a few seconds to process the question and statement…. ‘Ah shit’ I thought, ‘fuck, I’vegot that surfing lesson this morning’. More profanities echoed in my brain before I could think clearly.What did I do? I couldn’t think straight and needed an idea immediately. I hesitantly demanded “Couldyou wait half an hour?” The cool-headed Aussie said “Nah mate, where are ya?” “Queenscliff” I replied.The bloke mentioned to be on the corner of Bridge Road and Grey Cliff Street in 5 minutes if I wanted tobe picked up. I scrambled for my clothes, wet suit, deodorant and keys before legging it to the pick-uplocation.I reached the street corner; I could see a van with a heap of surf boards strapped to the roof. Was thisthe surf teacher’s mobile teaching wagon? Sure enough, it stopped; out jumped an Aussie surf dudedressed in board shorts and entertaining a thick, white zinc cream on his lower lip. He walked over andquestionably shouted “Dave?” I could feel a sense of relief through the haze of grogginess. ’Cool’ Ithought as I pulled the side door and entered effortfully into the van. I said hello before squeezing mycheeks between the other surfer wannabes.Life Turned Upside Down37 of 156We headed a short distance further up the beach to an area called North Curl Curl. The area wasmajestic; the virgin sands and calm waters lapping against the shore added to a semse of paradise. Theconditions were, according to the teacher, perfect for a spot of surfing. Unfortunately, there be dragons;more to the point, there be blue bottles (man-o-war jelly fish) sharing the surf area with us.Before grabbing a board and entering the shallows we were shown the basics of surfing on the beach.We were told to:1. Swim through the “breakers” (breaking waves) to get to a spot just beyond.2. Turn the board so it’s front points towards shore.3. Look over your shoulder.4. When the wave approaching you is 5 meters away begin paddling with the hand and arms, don’tstop.5. If the wave passes underneath the board, hard luck. If you somehow feel the board is movingforwards effortlessly, you’ve fluked it!6. Now’s the time to think about getting onto your feet, adopt a cobra stance then leap to yourfeet in one swift action.7. Try to look cool. If you can ride the wave all the way to shore, you are the dude!Yep, the basic steps would have worked for me if I had the energy. I don’t think a bottle of originalLucozade would have assisted. I was still drunk from the Christmas Party frivolities. All I could reallymuster was getting out to a calm spot in the ocean where I could lie down on the board and rest mylethargic body. I had owed at least a days' worth of recovery to my battered shell.During the surfing session, the powerful Aussie sun rays beat down on the surroundings. I was tired,thirsty and in need of sunscreen on all parts of my exposed body. I cleverly managed to cover my headand feet with factor 50. My hands though were completely forgotten. It was clear my paddlingapparatus was going to suffer after this surf session.When the surfing teacher called time, I was clearly relieved. I didn’t at any moment have to grapple witha motive blue bottle and I hadn’t broken any bones. Having been appreciatively dropped off at theQueenscliff apartment I wearily made my way to the decompression chamber, my bed, to slowlyrecovery from the effects of alcohol consumption.Water was to become the central theme to much of my recreational life. I developed a passion forsnorkelling, it was difficult not to, it was so easy to:1. Access the warm, clear waters of Manly Beach.2. Get ready, chucking a few items of equipment into a bag.3. See colourful wildlife close to a range of nooks and crannies around the rocky bay.Life at the Queenscliff flat was sublime. It was drawing ever closer to Christmas. My half-arsed attemptsto find a house share were still not going well. My desperation was starting to show at work; whenasked “how ya going?” I tended to drop the shoulders and mention my fickle accommodationshenanigans. The guys in the office were an encouraging, helpful bunch. Elliot was more than happy to Life Turned Upside Down38 of 156assist with temporary digs leading up to the Christmas Break. I had no other options, so appreciativelyjumped at the chance.Something else that played on my mind around that time was a young lady that got her details into mymobile phone. Whenever I scanned the few contacts I had, an entry named Elle Morgan-Thomasappeared. I must have done something right during the Christmas party. Well, I cannot solely attributethe success of obtaining a lady’s phone details to my suave and sophisticated pulling technique. No, acertain wing man, with a smile that only a mother could love, helped big time. Bruce, that man with thegrimace like smile, the talk and free reign of the company expenses started conversations with many agroup of ladies in the night club. His excuse for chatting to the ladies was “this is my mate Dave, he’s justcome over from England and is looking to get f*ck*d”. Bruce, bless him, got to the point in few terseterms.Since I did not have many phone numbers in the contacts section of my new iPhone, Elle MorganThomas’s stood out. I for many days I milled over contacting her. Every time I looked at my phone andthought about it, I had that “fluttery” feeling in my heart. I closed my eyes, unlocked my phone and senther a text. The language used was not Shakespearean, it was brief and general, but still, it took mebloody ages to construct. After hitting send, the text consumed my headspace. Was that the correctphone number? I wonder if she remembered me? I wonder what her personality is like. Is she going toreply? if she did not, should I remove her from my contacts?Elle replied almost immediately; to my relief she sent a smile face emoji and mentioned wing manBruce, the free drinks and the smooth talking. We used chat about the great man as a Segway to meetup. At that present moment in time I was temporarily located in the Sydney suburb of Annandale in theabode of my sharp-tongued colleague Elliot. Funnily enough, this was where Elle lived too. Cool, therewas a restaurant in the main shopping centre named “Made in Italy Annandale” that we agreed to meetat.An evening dinner date; why should I be extremely nervous? Well, when we did talk at the club it wasdark, I was “half cooked” and I could not hear anything over the noise of the music. I could not for thelife of me remember what she looked like. Why I did use my lovely shiny phone camera to take a snap!?Besides, the photo would have been shocking, given the lack of flash and crap camera tech.As I entered Made in Italy Annandale, I took a good look. I wished someone would stand out as MissMorgan-Thomas. I walked to all corners of the spacious Mediterranean eatery, but no, nothing. F*ck,was she here and I have stupidly overlooked her? Where is she?! The negative of thoughts of “I’ve beenstitched up” began to stew in the thoughts. I calmed down and took a seat, “she could be running late…I’ll give her 10 minutes”. I ordered a bottle of Tooheys New and nursed it while sporadically lookingdown at my iPhone.After 5 minutes I received a text, Elle had arrived and wondered where I was. It must have been dark inthe Argyle, it seems that both of us didn’t have a clue as to what each other looked like. I glanced intothe corners of the restaurant to see who could be Elle. My eyes locked onto one girl sitting by herself,bespeckled and reading a book. Could this be her? From a distance I absorbed her countenance in moredetail. I still did not recognise her. I took a second look around the room. Yep, she was the only womanon her own. It had to be her! Life Turned Upside Down39 of 156I took a swig of Dutch courage and walked slowly towards the prospective dinner date. As I approached,she looked up from her book. With an Aussie upward inflection, I said “Elle?” She smiled, stood up“Dave, right?” I confirmed and gave her a cursory kiss on the cheek.We both sat down and began chatting about the night of the Christmas Party. Elle looked much youngerthan I expected. I was 30 years old, she was 21. Not too long before leaving the UK for Australia I haddated 22-year-old. Going on a date with a 21-year-old was not too much of a shock. For an Aussie, herskin was soft and untarnished; her complexion was on par with a sun-starved Brit. Conversation flowedsomewhat that night, but there was not a connection. We enjoyed our food, kissed and left ourrelationship at goodbye. I took my hunched body and damaged ego back home to Elliot’s to rest for thenight.On approach to Christmas I forgot about the date with Elle. I had my sights set on the upcomingholidays. As was the case across Australia, every employee had to use holiday allowance over theChristmas period. It was a total of 2 weeks; in most cases people extended it. I had no appetite toextend mine, every day working from the office felt like a holiday.I had no idea what I wanted to do over the Christmas holidays. At home I would have been happystaying indoors and away from the harshness of the British wintery weather. Down under I wasexperiencing the heart of summer. Why stay indoors? Well, maybe to get a blast from the air con, butthat was not my style. Being English, if the sun was out, I was out, but with sweaty t-shirt rigidly attached to my body.Holidays… If I were in the UK, I would be looking at summer sun in the Mediterranean. In Australia Icould take a “short” 3-hour flight to New Zealand or… travel to Fiji, 4 hours. Why go to the effort offlying out of Australia when I had not experienced much of the great southern continent. What about aroad trip? Thanks to David Attenborough all I could picture was the wonderful Great Barrier Reef. If youhad given me a map at the time I wouldn’t have a clue where it was located. All I knew, from theconversations I had had, it was somewhere north of Sydney.Given my basic holiday plans I headed to Sydney’s bustling retail centre for talks with a travel agent.“Which travel agency should I visit?” I thought as I walked through an arcade near the large David Jones store. As with many decisions, the first one is usually “THE ONE”. The one in this case was STA Travel.STA Travel, for those who are unfamiliar, is not shabby by any means. It’s not unprofessional by anymeans. It is basic and budget friendly; perfect for me, with my short arms and deep pockets.As I looked at its brightly lit, cosy interior I was captivated by magazines featuring capitalised words:“EUROPE”, “ASIA” “SOUTH AMERICA”. Where was “AUSTRALIA?” As I turned, I heard the bright,feminine, upward inflection of the travel agent, “can I help?” She looked down at a vacant customerseat. I got the message, take a seat and discuss. I sheepishly greeted before planting my sweaty bum onthe synthetic seat surface. She asked me the bloody obvious, which needed to be asked. “Where wereyou considering of travelling to?” and “Would you be travelling alone?” YES! I had an answer for both ofthose. “I want to go to the Great Barrier Reef”, “I’ll be travelling alone.” She immediately reached for amagazine and placed it delicately on the desk. “Do you know of Oz Experience?” I looked at her blankly.She continued “It’s a bus that starts in either Cairns or Sydney and finishes in the other city, stopping atvarious destinations along the way.” “It’s shared accommodation, food is thrown in at some stops. Youcan stay at any of the stops for as long as you desire. There are several optional side trips too. Up to you Life Turned Upside Down40 of 156to get involved.” I was immersed; the travel agent had described something out of a dream. Me, myown boss, cruising the freeway in a bus travelling to destination this and that. Having the option to stopoff for as long as I want… Freedom. “Where do you recommend, I start?” “How long does the bus taketo get to the final destination?” The travel agent replied “I recommend starting in Sydney, less busythere. It takes over a week to get to Cairns.” Over a bloody week to get to Cairns! Did I hear her right?Where the bloody hell was Cairns on the brochure map. Looking at the map, travelling distance lookedinsignificant. When the UK was placed on the same scale map, the penny dropped. Sydney to Cairns byplane took 4.5 hours, a drive covering over 1500 miles. Put into context, the journey is double the lengthof the UK.I was all set for the Christmas holidays after purchasing my Oz Experience bus ticket. More good newsarrived; a room in a flat was available in Manly. Given the distinct lack of competition, I was accepted tomove in on my return from the Christmas break. You beauty! I wasn’t going to be alone on ChristmasEve either; Elliot has invited me to his girlfriend’s mom’s church gathering. It was a clear black night,warm, with the feeling of the festive period joviality. 10 of us, Christmas’s orphans, were shoulder-toshoulder sat outside around the long, dining table. Elliot's girlfriend's Mom would play the part of host,tending to our every culinary need. “Would you like some beer David?” I was asked. I looked at thestubby holder, noting the fluid level was below the stubby holder top. I took a swig to better ascertainthe spirit level. A swig progressed into a gulp, progressed into an empty bottle. “Yep, another VB wouldbe great thanks.” I replied.VB or Victoria Bitter was the beverage of choice in Australia. I could sense why, given its light, refreshingflavour. I heard many a VB related story; one described a change in the alcohol content of the beer,which resulted in uproar from Bruces and Shelas countrywide. Dare say, the formula of VB has been leftuntouched since its inception.A cornucopia of alcohol appeared on the dining table, indicating the main food event was to commence.Elliot, his Girlfriend, his Girlfriend’s Mom and Girlfriend’s Mom’s Partner were beavering away with foodpreparations. Out first were the vegetables: a selection of roasted potatoes, boiled carrots and greens.They were set down gently in the centre. With what seemed like hours, Elliot’s Girlfriend’s Momreturned with a huge silver platter. I looked at Elliot with dismay and asked what type of meat was beingserved. With his lively eyes and charismatic smile, he said “it’s TurDucken, a deboned chicken stuffedinto a deboned duck, stuffed into a deboned turkey!” Why someone would want to do this to three, finefeathered animals were beyond me. Why be dismissive, it may look ugly, but does it taste good? Igrabbed the carving knife and fork and began the experience. I placed a roughly cut piece onto my plateand stared at it for a while. It was analogous to delving into an archaeological dig. I was happy what eachlayer represented. Taking the correct amount of care to transport the layered monstrosity for sampling,while keeping its structural integrity, that was difficult. I skewered the beast with force. With one swiftmotion it entered my mouth. My focus switched to the flavours and textures of the TurDucken. Myexpectations were far higher than actual. Disappointingly, it wasn’t a taste sensation. A wise man namedRay from the film Ghostbusters once said “don’t cross the streams”; applying that to TurDucken, “don’tstuff one bird into another”. Hey, at least I crossed that one off the list. It was never on there prior tothis festive occasion.With TurDucken consumed, the table was cleared. More drinks arrived at its centre and quicklydisappeared into groups spread out in the four corners of the yard. The social aspect of the night began. Life Turned Upside Down41 of 156I hung around Elliot like a shadow, not knowing Jack from John. Elliot began chatting to an athletic,vacant looking, middle-aged bloke. As I was listening in, I got the feeling that there was more to this manthan met the eye. I could see that he was chewing gum like a cow chewed cud. He slowly lookedtowards me and introduced himself with a Kiwi droll. “Hi, my name is Tom, are you a member of thechurch?” I shook my head. “Ah okay”, I could see Tom begin to relax. He began to open, relaying theproblems he currently faced in his life. Truth be told the church was finding Tom to be a difficult nut tocrack. Tom had substance abuse issues; the church had tried hard to kick him from this habit, but hecontinued, nonetheless. He had good intention, go to church, say his prayers and “stay clean”. However,given his extensive history of “mixing with the wrong people” resulted in missed church visits andrelapse. The church had mentioned he was on his last warning. Any more antisocial shenanigans, he wasgone!Tom was happy to talk to anyone about his past. He was first and foremost a fighter; a fighter in theblood sport sense of the word. A closer look at his weathered physique confirmed that. As he relayedstories of fights, he illustrated toned-down versions of the fighting techniques he used. I was the personon the receiving end of his dramatised “light shadow boxing”. His fighting techniques weredemonstrated in a slow, precise fashion. I was in awe; this bloke was the real deal. I had some idea offighting techniques, given my exposure to the Japanese martial art Aikido. The techniques Tom usedwere far more powerful than that of any fighter I had sparred. During our one-sided conversation hedropped in the cursory mention of UFC. For those not aware of UFC, it is a stage where the best mixedmartial artists in the world combat. This guy barely standing before me was the first New Zealandentrant into the first ever UFC. The fact he appeared to be punch drunk was testament to his lack ofsuccess. He mentioned that he never won a match. He continued to describe his failed relationshipsoutside of fighting, with female partners that gave him a beating. Tom was one of most interestingpeople I had ever met. You never know who you expect to meet on your travels, especially amongstchurch-goers.The next morning Elliot was kind enough to drop me off at the South Sydney hotel, located oppositeSydney Central Train Station. I was encumbered with all my personal wears. After checking in I made myway to the hotel room, opened the door and threw myself onto the bed. It was so nice to have personalspace in a relative lap of hotel luxury. I had far too much luggage to take with me on my hols. I hatched aplan there and then to ensure I was going to take just the essentials on this Oz Experience road trip. Theplan, cheekily dump my excess luggage at the K.J.Ross & Associates Sydney office and hope it was stillthere when I got back.With luggage dumped, a slim lined and agile packed me was contemplating the finer things in my life.One of those things I considered fine were the hairs atop my head. A unkempt balding appearance is notgood. To alleviate this issue, without any specific hair cutting tools, I decided to use my Gillette razor tosee to my hair.What I did not envisage was how much effort was going to be involved. The amount of shaving cream,brute force and time was literally eyewatering. It got done, with a nick here and trickle of blood there.Feeling a freshly shaven head is an unusual sensation. A bald baby’s head feels soft, but the feel of arazor blade shaved head is like clasping a frog. The “skin head” look does have its good side, it hasliberalism baked in, a stance I leant towards. The bad side, it is associated with mindless violence; I am Life Turned Upside Down42 of 156as soft as merino wool. I would try to “rock it” to get people to see past its edginess and love thepersonality, the big softie.A huge benefit of staying at the South Sydney Hotel was it proximity to the Oz Experience’s coach pickup point. First thing in the morning I literally walked out the front door of the hotel and there the coachwas. A tall, thin Dutch looking bloke made his presence known as he looked over to me with a piercingglance. He shouted out my name in a deep ocker (stereotypical Aussie) accent. I smiled and walkedtowards this man with my case in tow. He threw my meagre luggage into the hold and indicated to geton board.The coach was large, enough seats for at least 100 people. It was surprising to find only a handful ofpeople in the coach, all located on the back row of seats. I said an enthusiastic “hello” and sat close byto where they were. I noticed just how young they were. I was 30, not an old traveller by any stretch. Istill fell within the age limit for the old school Club 18-30s trips. These tourists were fresh out of college.The one girl was obviously British, petite, big boned, with a southerner’s accent. She had attachedherself, in a friendly manner, to a tall 6’ blonde girl sitting beside her. She was German, the same age asthe English girl, well-mannered and extremely attractive. Finally, another youngster, older, but still 10years my junior was a chilled out Danish fellow. His skin looked like it had not experienced sunlight in itslifetime.We all started discussing the trip ahead, noting what we were looking forward to. None of us has a cluewhat the trip entailed other than it started in Sydney and finished in Cairns. We continued to chat as thebus’s engine started up. The air conditioning fired up and off we went. I was the last pickup before thebus was to make its way towards Sydney Harbour Bridge. As we navigated Circular Quay, a noticeablecrackling sound was audible over the bus’s speaker system. This sound was followed by a base-yexplosion as Jeff, our coach driver and guide, began adjusting his headset. “G’day” he exclaimed;everything Jess said was announced with an exclamation mark much the dismay of the coach’s speakersystem. He asked “how are you guys?”, “looking forward to the journey ahead?” We shouted a loud andresounding “YES!”. Jeff, being so far away from us at the front of the coach could just about hear ourreply and down-played how half-hearted our response was. We repeated, but this time with even morevigour. Jeff continued anyway; his dry, terse, Aussie sense of humour came through in droves. He spokeabout the Oz Experience; given how fluid the information was relayed to the passengers; it hadobviously rehearsed it many times.• Passenger/coach etiquette:o On board belongings security.o Keeping the isles free of items.o What should and should not be flushed down the loo.Jeff mentioned some of the optional trips in the itinerary including:• Byron Bay Surf n Stayo 1 Night dorm share accommodation.o 1 x surf lesson Meals (1xBreakfast / 1xDinner)o Unlimited use of all surfing equipment and wetsuit hire.• Fraser Island 4WD Tag-a-long Tour - 3Days/4NightsLife Turned Upside Down43 of 156o 4WD tour, tag-a-long style (2 nights dorm share accommodation) return ferry transfersfrom Hervey Bay National Park.• Whitsunday Sailing Tour - 2 Day, 2 Nighto 2-day, 2-night sailing tour On-board dorm share accommodationo All meals (1xBreakfast / 2xLunch / 1xDinner)o Snorkel and wetsuit hire Snorkel instruction.• Magnetic Island 1 Night Stopovero 1 Night dorm share accommodationo Return ferry transfers from Townsville.Jeff played a plethora of Aussie songs during the trip including one entitled “Come to Australia”, whichsummed up all fears that tourists had of Australia. Basically, be warned, you might accidently get killedby spiders, snakes, crocs, sharks, and box jelly fish to name a few of their infamous animals. Jeff usedthe gamut of Aussie phrases to ensure we were all well versed in the “No worries, no dramas, too easy”culture that Australia presented.The trip was special, my first experience of Australia outside the big city. The Whitsunday Sailing Tour,sailing by the power of the wind, surrounded by the clear, warm, calming waters of the tropics tookrelaxation to a new level.I was united with many other travellers on the trip. Most tourists I met, weirdly, were from Austria(maybe, Australia was chosen because of its similar name). The main activity that united us was socialdrinking. Drinking beer is a big part of everyday Aussie life. It is a great excuse to socialise; the Aussieshave the British to thank & curse for it. The Aussies have added much to the experience: better weather,colder, more refreshing beer and an insulating bottle blanket named a stubby holder.The day prior to the Oz Experience, I was over in Manly, outside the entrance to a house just off theboulevard. I rang the doorbell and moments later a dishevelled woman with black curly hair and a loosefitting dress appeared at the door. She spoke with a gravelly French accent, heavily influenced by hersmoking habits. She was approaching middle age, and age influenced her physical aroma. Flo was hername, and as her name implied, I had to go with her to check out the room for rent. As I traversed thelarge, open living space, I entered the room for rent.It had the following positive points:• High ceiling.• Free bed.• En-suite bathroom.It was dilapidated, but it did not matter, it was better than the alternative i.e., moving across Sydneyfrom one expensive temporary accommodation to the next.Flo tried a sales angle that I had never experienced before. She mentioned that she liked me, as if thethought of being liked by an unattractive person swayed my decision, and asked me what I thought. Idismissed the former part of her comment, excusing her for poor English grammar. I said I would behappy to move in if she was happy.Life Turned Upside Down44 of 156There were two ways of travelling to Manly, by land or by sea. The latter is what I was to becomeaccustomed to. Initially, the journey was majestic. The hustle and bustle of people. The elegant,synchronised movement of the ferries and the beautiful sights of Australian icons: The Sydney HarbourBridge and the Sydney Opera House.When it was time to board the ferry, if the weather was good, top and front of deck was where it was at.These seats were full of tourists. I would happily sit inside to obtain a better wifi signal and “stretch thelegs”. The view of the iconic Australian landmarks would ebb as the ferry moved past Woolloomooloo,the fortified Australian Naval Base. The majesty of the journey did not end there. The fun part of the tripbegan at Sydney Harbour Heads. It was an inhospitable area; the swell on that part of the trip wasimmense for a sea travelling newbie. It was here that the boat would rock n roll, giving Elvis’s pelvicthrusts a run for their money. The roll of the boat was unprecedented at times, feeling like the it wasgoing to capsize. I slowly got used to this sensation with more experience. When the going got rough, itnever ceased to put a smile on my face. Especially seeing the expression on passengers faces, new to thewhole experience. The approach to Manly Wharf was a memorable one because of the tall pines, thebustling promenade, and the German Beer Café.The pedestrianised promenade appeared in full view as I disembarked. It had that beach town feel, asand smothered the walkways and the sound of the sea breeze echoed in the trees. I could not believesuch a culturally different town existed so close to the city.I arrived back outside the Manly house-share accommodation with all my possessions, most of which Ihad retrieved from the Sydney work office space across the harbour. Flo, the acting landlady, was thereto show me around the new digs and to my vacant room. Flo, late for work, made her apologies beknown. I sat down heavily on the unadorned mattress shouldering my luggage. Unfortunately, the bed’sstructure was compromised, which saw me comedically fall straight through it. Embarrasingly I gatheredmyself back to my feet, placed my items down slowly and looked under the bed. I could see theproblem. Originally there had been at least 10 wooden beams to the mattress support. There nowexisted 7; at least I had knowledge of where I should place my body in future. Not at the end of the bedwas the answer.House sharing was new to me. Prior to the current living arrangements in Manly I had lived alone in atown house and with my family at their large detached home. I did not have a clue what the protocolwas for shared accommodation. What was my role in the house? What was the shared space? Whatrights did I have? My plan was to play it by ear and react to anything that felt amiss. And amiss was thebest way to describe the interior décor of the property. The best way to describe it was a dishevelledAustralian construct fused with a smoke-y French flamboyance. The flavour was hugely influenced bythe acting landlady Flo.Flo was a 40 something French cook. If she were a cheese, she would be a Bleu d’Auvergne, strong inflavour, but nothing to look at. The shoulder length black, wavy hair, baggy dress and gravelly Frenchaccent gave her an unmistakeable presence. She moved with a grace and veracity that contradicted suchan appearance. She loved her cats, all 4 of them. As a general life rule a cat owner with any more than 1cat should have their sanity assessed. The cats did what they wanted, which suited Flo’s libertarianphilosophy. This caused an issue to housemates, but not bother Flo. The cats took a poo wherever theypleased. The cats slept all day given their available, protein rich diet. What goes in, must come out; forthe largest of the cats it did daily. The place it frequented was the main bathroom that was shared by Flo Life Turned Upside Down45 of 156and Tom (the other flat mate). Flo would usually clean up before Tom used the bathroom first thing inthe morning, but there were several occasions when Flo was too late to act. Tom, on entering thebathroom, would let the household know about the issue by screaming “Flo!” at the top of his lungs.Tom was in his late 20s, a dishevelled looking festival goer, hailing from the North of England. When hewas not finding cat shit in the main bathroom, he was found in his room. Their he smoked copiousquantities of marijuana and drank Toohey’s New in his “beauty is in the eye of the beer holder” stubbyholder. He spoke with an eloquence that contradicted his outward appearance. Tom was well educatedand a season traveller. He loved Top Gear, that, beer, and England, bonded us. Each chat would usuallycentre about the awful state of the flat, and those bloody cats! He had no job and no real direction inlife. He was behind on his rental payments and constantly talking about his exit strategy from the flat. Ihad no issues with Tom, I respected his point of view, which was much in contrast with Flo’s.Flo, as I was to find out was going to be the bane of my life too. The only words she had to say to mewere of complaint. She complained that I did little around the house and that I should contribute moreto chores. Back then I worked on the principle of “what only I use, I clean, what we share, you take careof”, which did not lend itself well to the whole house-SHARE concept. I hated confrontation seeking toavoid her wrath if possible. Unfortunately, it meant any constructive communications between us werefew and far between.Thankfully, the flat was vacant most of the times I returned from work, thanks to Flo having to chef inthe evenings at the pub across the promenade, the Ivanhoe Hotel. There was the odd time when Ipassed by Tom’s ajar bedroom door where a chink of light pierced the darkened hallway. If that angelicoutline was there, which it usually was, I knew Tom was out, which he was most of the time. Strange,given he had no job, little money, and a full fridge shelf of Toohey’s New.Tom had copious amounts of beer on his assigned shelf in the fridge. A regular at a local pub once said“man can live on beer alone”; Tom was testament to this. I did not keep much in the fridge, I preferredto purchase my food from the local supermarket and slap it onto a plate when I got home. The Coles’pre-cooked ½ chicken with a side of lettuce & tomatoes was my idea of dinner. The chicken wasextremely greasy and as salty as a dead dingo’s donger. When I opened the chicken’s plastic-lined paperbag, the grease would flood out and form a grease puddle on the plate. I always set aside a knife andfork, which I never used. Eating chicken on the carcass, for me, was performed with the hands, teethand sleeves. My upbringing had shaped my eating behaviour. I never left the table without finishing myfood. With that mentality, I ensured that nothing, but the inedible bits of the chicken remained.After emptying the remains of the chicken into the swollen bin, I would consume Queensland’s summerseasonal speciality dessert, the mango. The mangos were yellow and enormous; consuming the sweet,sticky fruit, trying to stop its nectar from running down the arms took a coordinated effort. Thestickiness of the mango juice and the grease of the Coles cooked chicken meant for a messy, butpleasurably cheap meal.My post meal-time timetable was well structured:1. Take 2 steps to the bedroom.2. Lie on bed.3. Fire up laptop and binge watch an American TV show. Life Turned Upside Down46 of 156The room was large, high-ceilinged, with little furniture. The ruffled bed and chest of drawers were leftby the previous occupants. A large walk-in-wardrobe was accessible as well as a shared bathroom.Unfortunately, with little applied TLC, it was left in a state fit for stoners, junkies and me (peopledesperate for a house share).The view from my room lacking. Given I lived 2 blocks away from Manly Beach, the only sea-frontfeature I could make sense of was the tops of Manly Beach’s fern trees. A glance directly below thebedroom window revealed many industrial sized garbage bins. It was the height of summer, with thebedroom lacking adequate air conditioning the window needed to be opened. If the noisome smell didnot impact you, then the cockroaches that scaled the walls would.Being from the UK, my contact with creepy crawlies at night was minimal. The Australian environmentintroduced a raft of new animals. On particularly humid nights I questioned the window, “how ajar isenough for comfort and enough to keep the beasts at bay”. One night I was asleep with windows wideopen. I tossed and turned; the humidity was discomforting. As I Iay there in a foetal position I feltsomething scurry across my feet. I was tired and dismissive about what it could be, so I ignored thesensation. Whatever it was, hopefully the encounter was a fleeting one. I quickly settled back into sleepmode. A few seconds passed; the sensation of something crawling up my leg caused me to kick outforcefully. My heart raced, I sat bolt upright and reached for the bed side light switch. It was on the wall,and it saw me. The cockroach, a monster arthropod, was lying in wait for my next move. Given itsimmense size, had experience on its side. I’m sure it had many encounters with people in its long life. Icould sense it was mocking me; beckoning me to make the next move. I stood there, clad only in boxershorts. I reached for my bedside flip-flop (thong) ready to thrash the beast. I ran towards the wall andswung my flip flop into the space that once was occupied by the cockroach. The new space it occupiedwas a good 5 metres away. I again ran towards the cockroach, slapping an empty space. This meleecontinued for 5 minutes. I placed my hands on my hips, breathing laboured, with flip-flop claspedloosely in my right hand. I shook my head; my plan of attack needed adjusting. I waited for a moment ofinspiration that never arrived. I had one simple thought, if at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. I waswrong, if you repeat the same actions, you’re going to get the same outcomes. In my case, failure to killthe cockroach. As my tired mind began accepting defeat, the deft cockroach finally thought better thanto stay in an unwelcoming environment and buggered off back out the window. I slumped in back in mybed. I had one eye open and gripped my pillow tight that night.When I woke up on the weekends, usually worse for wear after a night of social drinking, I would oftenwalk from my room into the kitchen. Enjoying breakfast was a simple matter of grabbing a bowl, spoon,2 Weetbix biscuits, milk and a spot at the breakfast table. For variety’s sake I would sometimes eat inthe balcony area located just off the living room. The balcony faced out onto the side street below. Itsconcrete floor was awash with used cigarettes and pots of sand. It was, for the most part, Flo’s cheekysmoking hideaway. Unfortunately, the smoke would carry in through the door that connected thebalcony to the lounge, leaving a stale tobacco smell throughout the whole apartment. I wouldsometimes take my breakfast over to the lounge sofa and turn on the TV. It was there that one day,wearing only my boxer shorts, I felt something crawl on my skin. This time it was a different, more subtlesensation. But it stopped me in my tracks. I looked closer at my legs. Initially I couldn’t see it. I studiedmy leg acutely. The only carpeted room in the house was the lounge. My brain began to piece togetherthe puzzle. Where did Flo’s collection of cats often reside? Yep, the lounge. What was on my leg? Afamily of fleas.Life Turned Upside Down47 of 156I made a mental note, adding the following list of questions to ask prior to renting a room:1. How many cats do you have? If the landlady replies with a number greater than 1, run away!2. Given you have failed to take your own advice to question 1, next question should be “where doyour cats do their business?” If the answer is not “outside” or “in a kitty litter tray”, check yourwatch, look flustered and run!3. Given desperation & stupidity, follow up the prior 2 questions with “do carpet fleas troubleyou?”I could now see the haze that thrived in the lounge, a haze of fleas. The only respite from the swarm wasthe settee, an island surrounded by carpet. I felt unclean… I had to get out of there and return to myquarters, doing so with a hop, skip and jump. That was the last straw. I didn’t want to be there anymore.I had to find a new place.I felt lonely; my best mates in Sydney were Bruce “the K.J.Ross Consultancy Services Salesman”Rawsthorne, Tom “The Vagabond Flatmate” Price and Flo’s “Flea Circus”cats. All were busy over theChristmas period. The latter were shut away in the cat toilet, waiting for Tom’s return. I sat in bed andthought about the date of romance I had prior to Christmas. As uneventful as the encounter was, therewas a small spark that glimmered away in the recesses of my heart. I had a thought, ‘I wonder whatshe’s up to?’ ‘Would I be stupid to send her a short message?’ ‘I’ve got tails of my recent holidayadventure to tell.’ With that thought, the iPhone was out, and the texting fingers quickly worked theirmagic, crafting the follow-up text. The text read “Hi Elle, hope you are well? I’ve recently returned frommy Sydney to Cairns, East Coast Trip. I really enjoyed meeting you before the Christmas Break. It wouldbe great to see you again. Dave” Short, sweet, simple, sent. I waited for the bait to be taken.I lay the phone down and tried to sleep; sleep was light as my heart and thoughts raced. I was ready topounce at the phone, if by chance, she replied. I waited… and waited… I got restless, got up and begancleaning the room. I glanced occasionally over at my phone. I looked at it, willing it to make a sweetapple iPhone notification sound. “Come on phone, do something!” I repetitively walked over to check,nothing. “Elle, why? Why don’t you respond?” I checked the time, 2 minutes had passed. I felt suicidal.Anger took hold at this point, the f-ing and blinding turned the air blue. “F*ck it, I didn’t like youanyway…!”, I said loudly. At that moment, the phone buzzed. I leapt onto it like a peregrine falconsnatching an unexpecting pigeon. My heart raced, I looked away. It was difficult to bring myself toreading the reply. A plethora of ‘What ifs…?’ filled my mind. I tried to second guess what the text couldbe. I unlocked the phone, opened one eye and cautiously read the first sentence. “Hey Dave, it was goodto meet you too…”. It felt like passing an exam I thought I had failed. I leapt from my bed, punched theair with joy and shouted “YES, YES, YES!” I was happy to leave my thoughts there, but rememberedthere were a number of sentences still to read. I tentatively returned to look at the text. “It would begreat to hear more about your trip. I’m busy with studies over the next couple of days, I’m free Saturdayevening? Elle x.” Was that a kiss crafted at the end of the sentence. She loves me, she really loves me!Bloody hell. I wanted to reply immediately, but there was a chance she would sense my desperation andignore me. I had to be cool; breathe, wait, think, text!I made my desperation wait 5 minutes and began crafting my next response, which I was able to withlittle editing. “Sounds great. I’m currently living over in Manly. Happy to head your way if its more Life Turned Upside Down48 of 156convenient. Let’s meet at a bar over at Circular Quay, how does 7:00pm sound?” It felt like interviewingfor a new job. I had passed the 1st dating stage and was happily progressing to stage 2. I pondered mychances of winning this opportunity.I had little relationship experience prior to meeting Elle. I find it difficult to remember the women Idated; odd, given I had only dated 2. Of those relationships, it was Sam, a girl I met through datingwebsite OkCupid, that stood out. At the time, I was 29, Sam was 27; we both lived in Lichfield. Othercommonalities included: Facebook, drinking & humour (our first date was at a comedy club). If I wasbeing pedantic, I could add existing to that list. She was gorgeous. She was brilliant at social media, butcrap at the face-to-face human interactions. A pity, we ended the relationship via Facebook, with meranting about her inability to make the time to meet me in person.In my late 20s, early 30s I was questioning the norms, reading life altering books by authors like JaredDiamond. It dawned on me what success meant; from an animalistic perspective I made it a goal to havekids. I believed I needed a woman in my life to achieve that goal. Embarrassingly, I had a problem, andwould later find out much to my embarrassment, that I lacked a sex drive. When I look back into myearliest memories of sex, it all seems a bit odd. Before I reached 10 years of age, I got an unexplainablepleasure from sliding down metal poles. I remember my first erection; I was watching the weekly, musictv show “top of the pops”. The sight of an 80s Italian pop star and model overwhelmed my senses. As ayoung teen going through puberty, I was getting an erection hourly. My penis would stand to attentionduring the car journey to school, during every class I attended and, on the walk, home. I never doubtedmy sexuality; I had a socially acceptable attraction to females. I loved large breasts; arguably I wasobsessed with that child-rearing feature. It confirmed a theory, I found women who were shaped andlooked like my mother, attractive. As a child, teenager, and young adult I never thought of my mom asbeing attractive. Women that were the younger spitting image of her, however, I did.At school, I understood men, I grew up with 2 brothers. My dad was my idol. I treated women withsocial distancing. I was shy, I didn’t understand them and didn’t have the courage to bridge the socialgap. When I got home from school, I masturbated to mental images of curvy women from class. Itbecame a habit; later with the introduction of the internet, it became extremely easy to continue. Ididn’t realise what impact this obsession was having on my mental health. When I was legally allowed todrink alcohol, I believed I couldn’t socialise with women without being drunk. I had a problem withtreating women as human beings.My interactions with women would become healthier after I entered my first job as a shop assistant atWHSmith. Men were in the minority; I was able to interact with many women as a result, whichimproved my social health no end. I had to play a serious amount of catch up. Slowly I gained anappreciation for women as human beings, but work did little to stop me masturbating in my room athome.In my 20s my sexuality matured. I brainwashed myself. I believed I was heterosexual. How could aperson, like me, not be heterosexual if I masturbated to images of women? But I felt an attraction tomen. I could not deny that feeling. Did I want to explore that desire sexually? No, it made me feeluncomfortable. With all males that I got along with and found attractive, I only wanted friendship. Iquestioned if I was gay, straight, bi-sexual, null or void? Googles answer id great, “you are not alone inquestioning your sexual orientation”. I appreciated the female form. I was comfortable with the thought Life Turned Upside Down49 of 156of having sexual intercourse with women. However, as I later found out with Elle, I did not have thelibido to have sex with any woman.For years I was sexually aroused by pornographic images of large breasted women. I later discovered Iwas aroused by pictures of large penises. Why did large sexual organs arouse me? Subconsciously, it wasdominance. I found people of power attractive. Pornography portrayed people with large sexual organsas the ones with that power. I have imposed mental restrictions; I don’t want to have sex with men.Conversely, if a woman does not have “powerful” bodily features i.e., large breasts and a curvaceousform, I will not find her attractive.I had very little sexual experience prior to meeting Elle. I had “successfully” intercourse with twofemales, both prostitutes in foreign countries, when I was in my 20s. I failed on 2 other, more recent,occasions, a work mate and a friend of a friend. Subconsciously, this concerned me.I arrived at Circular Quay, having spent the best part of half an hour commuting across the SydneyHarbour Head. As I walked across the square, I felt nervous. Should I bail? I was showered and smartlydressed. I cared for this occasion. Elle chose the meet up point, an easy to locate pub with outsideseating. I racked my brain as to what she looked like (it had been over a month since I last saw her). Thememory of her in the dark and dingy Italian restaurant had faded significantly. Was she attractive? Whatdid we talk about? I had a back-up plan; if the chat didn’t flow, I would talk about my recent holiday.Was that going to impress her? I felt pessimistic; was this going to be our last date?As I approached the pub’s outdoor seating area, I instantly recognised her. Thankfully, she was the onlylone white female. She looked prettier than I remembered. I watched her glance to her right, taking avacant look into the bright space of the harbour. I nervously approached her table, smiled and tried toget her eyes to meet mine. Her face lit up, a smile beaming across it. She got out of her seat and gaveme a hug with the warmth one would give to an old acquaintance. I was happy and surprised to begreeted in this fashion.We both sat down at opposite ends of the 4-seater, medium sized table. I took a look at Elle’s half fullglass of cordial and asked if she wanted another drink. She took a sip through a straw and nodded,releasing her lips from the straw opening. “Yeah, okay, lemon and lime cordial please. I need to studyhard tomorrow, can’t drink tonight” she said. “Right, lemon and lime cordial” I repeated. I entered thebar and looked at the blackboard behind the bar attendant. The sign read “Mondays-Thursdays, 6-8pm,$4 schooners of VB”. There was another sign beside that, “Mondays-Thursdays, 6-8pm, Steak and Chipsfor $10”. I made a mental note of the latter for a future dinner choice. The former was an offer Icouldn’t refuse. I’m sure Elle chose the venue to suit her student monetary needs. I couldn’t complain, itsuited my cheap-as-chips, but high-quality, mantra.I returned to our table outside with drinks in hand, ready to bring my holiday stories to life. Not being aperson to drive conversation, it was Ella that spoke first. She asked, in a caring fashion synonymous withAustralians, “how are you?”. This question was quickly followed with another, “what was your holidaylike?”. I had forgotten I had texted her during the holiday about my shenanigans. I found Elle’s ability toconfidently drive the conversation very attractive. Looking at her captivating eyes and smiley face, shelooked cute too. I replied, “I’m good and the holiday was brill, cheers for asking.” I began to elaborate onthe holiday experience. I mentioned I had visited the largest sand island in the world, “Frasier Island”.She corrected my phonetics “it’s Fray-ser Island, not Fray-zyer island.” In true English fashion I apologies Life Turned Upside Down50 of 156then enthusiastically relayed excerpts from my Fraser Island story including: “The bus driver drove thisclose to the trees.” “The bi-plane pilot didn’t even bother looking out the window.” The captivated lookon Elle’s face showed signs of positivity. Time had flown by; Elle was looking at her watch signalling thatshe had to get back home to finish her studies. I looked at my empty glass of beer and happily called abreak on precedents. I kissed her goodnight and began walking back to the Manly ferry, chest out andhead held high. I felt confident I would see her for date number 3.Over the next weeks my relationship with Elle began to develop and so did the frequency and size of ourmobile phone texts. My phone was in constant use. This wasn’t so bad outside of work. I didn’t have agreat deal going on in my life other than dedicating time to Cole’s supermarket cooked chicken section.However, in work I was being distracted, context switching more often. Writing computer code ismentally taxing. Having the consolatory iPhone buzz and _DING_ all day resulted in my productivity“going down the gurgler”. My manager, Daniel, would pop into my section to mock me and my phonealerts. Dan could initiate a personal conversation e.g., is that your lady friend texting you. He was goodat exposing a flaw in your response. Any response would be met with banter, he’d then switch tomanager mode in a couple of sentences. He often complained to his boss that we were not beingproductive. My thoughts at the time were “well, Mr Allam if you stopped f*ck*ng distracting us, and ifmy phone didn't send notifications every 2 minutes, we’d be more likely to meet your deadlines”.It was easy to bond with Dan. He came from a middle-class family upbringing in the south of England.We did share a similar sense of humour, a love for the outdoors and heavy metal music. He was a rockerin a business suit, but without the associated aesthetics. During our lunch break we, David Playford, Danand I, would follow Dan’s lead. Dave Playford and I were new to Sydney. Dan would take us to variousfood courts and retail establishments. He loved visiting Allans Music + Billy Hyde located on the HighStreet. Dan had a penchant for the handmade, Australian Maton acoustic guitar. I favoured the electricvarieties, especially the Gibson range. Dan tried his best to find a Maton that wasn’t firmly secured tothe wall. He'd grab a stool and begin strumming a soft metal medley. He was transfixed playing theguitar, so much so I felt I was invading his personal space. When he was in that zen state, I would find aguitar of my own. However, I never quite got to the same state of flow that Mr Allam had attained.As I placed a cheap looking Fender Stratocaster on the thigh of my right leg I began communicating withit by playing my rendition of The Animals classic “House of Rising Sun”. The guitar sounded awful; it wasso out of tune that it sounded more like a bass than a lead. Unfortunately, I did not have the earrequired to tune the instrument manually. A guitar tuner was required for such a job. I tried my best totighten the guitar strings so it would produce a sound familiar to the ears of a tone-deaf roadie. As Ibegan to play without an amp, I felt the presence of Johnny Marr (the lead guitarist of band The Smiths).I could sense the presence of the legend. His ghostly image looked at me and said in a broad Mancunianaccent “put that guitar down and leave now, you’ve murdered that tune!”Dan removed himself from the ebb and flow of the Maton’s heart strings. He walked over to me as Iswitched to my 2nd and final song for the session, “The Sultans of Swing” by band Dire Straits. It was thefirst guitar tablature I had religiously self-taught. It had been a while since I played it. Like a phoenixfrom the flames, my fingers placed themselves reassuringly on the correct strings and frets. As I pluckedaway, the spirit of Mark Knopfler (the lead guitarist) took over and the rest of the performance oweditself to a huge dose of muscle memory. The rendition did nothing to doff the cap to the musical artistryof Knopfler; It was more a gentle nod. Dan appreciated my rendition. He began talking with the ebb and Life Turned Upside Down51 of 156flow of his husky, base-y tone “Mr Clarke… and the Sultans of Swing. Lovely.” I was happy it received hisappreciation.I was beginning to spend more time with Elle. When we weren’t together, we texted. Sometimes it wasidle chit chat, other times it was borderline sex chat. We even visited the cinema together. At the time3D was seeing a resurgence on the big screen and home entertainment units. One evening after work,we visited the Hoyts cinema in Sydney City Centre. The film of the moment was a production calledAvatar; its plot was written in the same style as epic adventures including the Matrix and Star Wars. Itwas a 3D film, which unfortunately forced us to wear 3D Glasses. It was doubly frustrating for four-eyedme, who had to wear the 3D glasses above my ordinary spectacles. It was a great film to take a date to;It had moments of love, sadness and euphoria. Elle and I, up until this point in our dating history, hadonly kissed each other at the end of the previous date. Time spent sitting together in the cinemaallowed a chance to take the next steps. I slowly reached out to hold her hand, which was met withreciprocation. We turned and tried to kiss each other, but the 3D glasses stopped our lips from touching.We smiled, removed the glasses and began to smooch. Elle enthusiastically asked me to follow her lead.She wanted to reproduce the 101 Dalmatians film kissing moment. We didn’t have spaghetti, so we triedthe scene with pop-corn to a degree of success. The whole being together felt heart-warming, evenmore so in light of one of the greatest films of the 21st Century.A bout of texts between me and Elle resulted in dinner invitation at her student flat in Annandale.“Excellent” I thought, but I was ill prepared for such a venture. This was the first time I had been invitedto a female friend’s home. When I finished work, I headed to the main bus stop located at Circular Quay.Thankfully, according to my iPhone, only one bus was required to get me within walking distance ofElle's home. Not being completely entrusted in technology I did ask a bus driver, who confirmed theroute was correct.The bus journey was slow. I gathered my thoughts about the upcoming meal. What, other than themeal, did Elle have in mind? How should I behave? Should I have a plan of action? Never mind thosethoughts, when I exited the bus all I could think about was how do I get to her house? Thankfully Elleprovided succinct directions. After ascending a flight of stairs, I found the front door, I knocked. It took ashort time before it flung open and a welcoming figure appeared. Elle stud there with arms wide openand a smile on her face. “Dave!” she exclaimed, with enough enthusiasm to fill a village hall. I warmlyembraced and kissed her. As we released our embrace, I immediately noticed her sense ofdisappointment. Being a forthcoming person, she said “Where is my gift? You don’t just turn upsomeone’s house, when they’re offering you food, and not bring along a gift for the host!” I did whatBritish people do best, humbly apologise and look sheepish. She returned a forgiving glance, smiled,hugged me again before skipping jovially to the kitchen. “I hope you like pasta, tomato and basil?” sheshouted. I replied “I’m not a fussy eater by any stretch.” I had survived my mother’s poor-qualitycooking for 25 years.Elle was a student; by student’s standards she lived well. The apartment was humble, but includedeverything a person required to live in comfort. As I walked through the hallway, I was met with thekitchen area, cooker was on the right, dining table centre and bathroom just off to the left. Beyond thedining room table lay her high double bed with shelves surrounding it. The bedside window let muchneeded light into the apartment, penetrating as far as the dining table. Life Turned Upside Down52 of 156My bladder, as usual, requiring immediate attention, followed swiftly by my suit jacket. It was dampwith sweat thanks to Sydney’s summer humidity. I tucked my ruffled shirt in and asked Elle fordirections to her bathroom. I was slowly adopting the Australianised word for toilet, bathroom.Thankfully, the Aussies did keep some British versions of words close to their hearts: mate, jumper,mobile phone. I loved the Australian version of the word duvet, doona.I returned from the bathroom and asked Elle if I could have a look around her home as she preparedfood. She happily obliged. It didn’t take long to absorb its every detail, given its small size. One group ofitems that were distinctive, were her books on politics. She was obviously studying this subject. By thesheer quantity of references books I assumed she knew the subject well.She began serving dinner, placing the pots of food on the worktop near the gas hobs. I was elated to seethe pasta dish, served with much care and love. Elle loved food and it showed in the manner in which itwas presented. Elle placed the dishes and cutlery on the dining table place mats. She walked over to hermusic player and pressed the play button and made a bee-line for the bathroom. The music grabbed myattention immediately. The tracks were all modern & melodic, but I didn’t recognise any particular tune.As Elle returned, I asked which bands were playing? She smiled and said she had created a specialplaylist just for me. Artists such as: Sneaky Sound System, The Temper Trap, Powder Finger and The CatEmpire were just some of the bands represented. I smiled as I wolfed down the pasta dish. Elle ignoredmy unusual eating habits. With eyes widened, a trivia question arrived on her lips. “Do you know whatthe tracks I’ve played have in common?” she exclaimed. My focus was still on the sumptuous food as Islurped the remainder of the bolognaise sauce. I shook my head. I knew the modern music scene in theUK well. I did know that they weren’t “big” bands on the international western stage. Elle bubbled withjoy as she blurted out the answer, “Australian! All the bands you’ve heard on the playlist areAustralian!!”. I contemplated responding with “good on ya”. Unfortunately, I didn't fully understandwhat that phrase meant.She rushed over to the fridge and brought back a packet of confectionary goods that looked somewhatlike British McVities Penguin chocolate biscuits. “Hey Dave, have you ever tried Tim Tams? Moreimportantly, have you ever tried caramel Tim Tams?” she jovially asked. My dumbfounded expressiongave answer to that. She handed me the packet to take a closer look. My gut instinct was correct, thecreators of Tim Tam had plagiarised McVities Penguin and repackaged them. I unwrapped one andbegan eating; the endorphin rush began, one crumbly, sweet Tim Tam, became two, became three. Iwas lost in the moment; thankfully Elle grabbed my attention and asked me to sit with her on the edgeof her high, double bed.Elle looked at me, her eyes glistening, her smile radiant. She was cute, her skin looked so tender. I couldsee her focus shift from my eyes to my chin as she edged closer. I delicately reached out to feel how softher face was. Our mouths touched. As I continued to kiss her, Elle used her body to direct my senses.The kissing became more passionate; my arousal levels began to soar. She instructed me to kiss an areaat the back of her left ear. On doing so she began to groan with pleasure. The sound was enthralling,spurring me to continue. After minutes of foreplay, I stopped to catch my breath. We stared at eachother fondly; Elle broke the silence, “I get really horny when I get kissed on the neck… I will really wantto fuck you if you continue to do that.” She smiled again; I looked at her with a contradicting seriousnessdemeanour. I leaned in and kissed her on the neck; We began to shed our clothes. I made sure my workclothes were well organised on the floor. I had to look smart for work the next morning.Life Turned Upside Down53 of 156I kissed Elle from neck to toe, spending a lot of time appreciating her breasts. This was the first time Ihad experienced foreplay without the influence of Alcohol. It was more stimulating than any previoussex I had had. However, I wasn’t stimulated enough to have sex.I continued, kissing her vagina, using my tongue to flick the labia. Elle’s sounds of pleasure increased inpitch and volume. She shouted “fuck me!” At that moment I sensed my penis was not fully erect. Anyamount of self stimulation was not working. I panicked, improvising, I began to penetrate her vaginawith my fingers, and continued to lick her labia. Elle screamed with pleasure; it wasn’t long before myright arm began to tire. The left arm was tagged to assist. Given the lack of air conditioning and humidconditions, I was beginning to dehydrate.Elle could sense my frustration. We slowed proceedings and sat together on the side of the bed. Shebegan rubbing my semi-erect penis, sucking it with a combination of tongue, teeth and lips. Thesensation was somewhat dulled, given the lack of sensory receptors on the penis. My penis, for amoment, became fully erect. Elle, excitedly reached for a condom and attempted to place it on mypenis. My penis began to return to its flaccid state. After multiple attempts of oral stimulation, withpenis semi-erect, I ejaculated. The sex stopped, I looked apologetic, then I lay next to her. Elle offeredwords of consolidation. We were both tired, enjoying the final moments of our embrace.During the night I was happy to kiss her body. She had such beautiful skin that, like a moth to a light, Icouldn’t help but be attracted to it. I got little sleep given the humidity and my unusual sleepingposition. When Elle’s alarm rang first thing in the morning, I couldn’t muster the strength to get up. I layin bed as Elle readied herself for the day. I slept with one eye open to get a glimpse of her as she gotdressed. Last night she had worn contact lenses. This morning she was wearing glasses. They suited her,signifying her intellect. I could see she was focused on her routine. It took me great effort to release mybody from the soft mattress, but tried I did. My work clothes were strewn across the floor, not at allfashioned for the daily grind at E*Trade. Given the time, I had no time to shower. I applied the crumpledgarments to my body, yawned and looked sheepishly over at Elle. She looked frugal, ready to take onthe day. I looked ready to take on more sleep. Thanks to Elle’s influential energy I felt compelled tofollow take her lead as she exited the flat. She pointed in the direction of her university, turned 180degrees and pointed at the city. “Dave, you that way, me this way. Catch the 470 bus on this side of theroad.” I lifted my head to give her one last kiss before saying goodbye.As she walked away, I saw the bus approach. I managed to flag it down, hop on board and grab a seat asclose to the front as possible. I felt paranoid, it must have been obvious to other passengers why Ilooked in such a dishevelled state. I just wanted to sleep. Unfortunately, there wasn’t a bed on-board. Idid manage to use deodorant that morning. The smell of the deodorant hopefully would disguise anywhiff of sex that was present on me. I was happy my bag was light, by laptop bag standards. My laptopwas a key tool I for client engagements. It kept me in touch with the consultancy. Much like a Batmansymbol shining on the clouds, it gave me access to assistance to do battle. I wish I could have used itthere and then to rescue me from a day at E*Trade. I slumped in the bus seat, occasionally looking outof the window to see my ghostly image staring back at me. I closed my eyes briefly only for my thoughtsto be consumed by what the day ahead had in store for me. Unfortunately, it was bad news. I realisedthat today there was going to be a presentation. I was going to be one third of its creative output. Thisdidn’t phase me; what did, was the thought of facing Dan Allam. The English joker was going to have afield day when I rolled into work, late.Life Turned Upside Down54 of 156As I approached my work desk, I unglued the backpack from my moist back. I placed it on one of themany chairs that were strewn around the segregated testers lab area. I took the laptop out of the bagand placed it gently onto the desk surface. I could pick out the faint sound of footsteps. Unsurprisingly,Dan pop his head in with a not too happy look on his face. I hadn’t seen the serious side to Dan “thejoker” Allam. Bring back the slapstick joker, my mind cried. Dan took a good look at me. His seriousnessslowly crumbled, replaced with a wide beaming smile. His demeanour reflected a fox that had taken allthe chickens from the hen house. His voice was slow, and tone deep, “so Mr Clarke, was Mrs Clarke anygood last night?” He opened his mouth, extended his tongue and began simulating licking a lollipop. Ilooked at him with a smug smile on my face, “she was alright” I said. I continued “I gave her 3 inches ofEnglish Cumberland Sausage that I’m sure she’ll order again.”It was a memorable day if Elliot was part of it. Today was his first time visit to E*Trade. His focus is andforever will be, money. He had the art of self-presentation mastered. He always looked the part whenarriving on client site. His slim, 6’2” stature, boyish looks purveyed a trustworthy, respectful appearance.He made sure his formal attire was iron board smooth, hair gelled, filo-fax shining and his smile switchedon. Elliot exited the lift to meet me in the hallway, he shook my hand, smiled and immediately asked forthe location of Srikanth’s office. Srikanth, a man of Indian descent and head of IT, was the man that heldthe purse strings. Elliot wanted to ensure he spent the majority of the morning loosening those pursestrings. As Elliot saw Srikanth his smile beamed, “You must be Srikanth, I’m Elliot Caldwell, K.J.Ross &Associates”. I returned to my desk in the lab and looked at the presentation. I took a look at thetemplate that Elliot had sent over the night before. Dave Playford and I had butchered it using technicaldata from various sources. Elliot had tainted it further with K.J.Ross financial data under the heading“savings after test automation”.The PowerPoint presentation was, in essence, bullshit. Its aim was solely to impress the key fund holder,Srikanth. Up until that point, me and Dave Playford had achieved very little. We created a couple ofsketchy automation proof of concepts that worked with a lot of manual intervention. No way did wehave a gold standard solution. The result of me and Dave efforts would hopefully allow KJRoss to deliversomething that would look, from the correct viewing angle, like the real deal. We just needed Elliot tomake sure he was well versed.Before the presentation was finalised, Elliot, having finished his meeting with Srikanth, popped over tosee me and Dave Playford with Mr Allam in tow. Elliot’s smile still beamed. The glint in his eyes indicatedeither he was going to make love to us or make money by using us. Thanks god it was latter. I was tootired to get screwed again in the space of 12 hours.Dan left Dave, Elliot and I to the secrecy of the Test Lab. Elliot’s eyes darted around the enclosed space,to pick out anything that looked like recording device. He quickly looked at me, then Dave Playford andsaid, “did you get to look at the presentation template that I sent over?” Dave and I looked at eachother, nodded, looked at Elliot and simultaneously said “yep!” "Well, can I have a look at it”, hedemanded. Elliot took one look at his wrist watch. He told us the presentation of our proof of concepthad been scheduled for 11:00. The time was now 9:00am; we still had time to polish this presentation.Elliot immediately took charge. He began to swiftly delegate parts of the presentation to me and Dave.He pasted in a couple of standard slides around cost savings. It was decided that Elliot would do themajority of the talking. Dave and I would step up when it was time to perform a demonstration. Wecleverly selected an automated test that had a 50/50 chance of running without our assistance.Life Turned Upside Down55 of 156It was 10:45, we were ready. My laptop was under my arm as we approached the meeting room. Theatmosphere felt wild west. We, the outlaws, were walking into a saloon full of unsavoury characters. Wemeant business, flashing a view of our weapon, the laptop, as we approached the table. Hopefully theaudience wasn’t going to take a pot shot at us.Elliot looked at me and Dave nervously. He had a high-level appreciation of what we sent here to do, buttechnically he had no idea. Dave Playford and I were on hand to assist answering anything technical. Assoon as I got the projector working, I used the laptop to fire up the presentation. I gave Elliot the nod.He took the baton like a well-versed relay runner. He looked up at the audience, walked to the front ofthe stage, adjusted his tie and smiled. His stature commanded everyone’s attention; the bustle of theroom distilled into silence. He looked at me and nodded, indicating he would like to see the first slide."G’day" he said impactfully. Throughout the presentation Elliot used simple phrases. His pitch, volumeand pace indicated confidence. As I proceeded clicking through the slides, Elliot’s tempo increased. Thesmile on his face widened when the financial benefits slide appeared. It was obvious this slide, his onlycontribution to the slide pack, was where his focus lay. His eyes lit up. When the presentation finished,Dan and Srikanth looked at each other in an agreeable, accommodating fashion. Elliot had, as Baseballfans would describe it, “knocked the ball out the park”. He knew he’d managed to send the correctmessage to Srikanth and was now looking at the next phase to loosen those purse strings further, theScope of Work document.As good as Elliot was at sales it was Bruce, Head of Sales and Marketing in Sydney, that wrote thestatement of work. It wasn’t a difficult task: download the K.J.Ross & Associates document template,cut, paste, done. It was going to be weeks before the document would be signed by E*Trade. There waslots of red tape to get through. What were Dave Playford and I to do in the interim? Return to the officebench. The bench in a consultancy was much like that of a sports team bench. The only difference, yourwhole team could be on the bench while the game played. There was always work out there to tenderi.e., a document that mentioned our services and how competitive we were for the business beingoffered. Bruce would often try to sweeten any deal by taking out the prospective client for lunch ordinner, all expenses paid for. Bruce would often times invite me to join him in these informal salesmeetings. Most of the time I would sit there like a plum, given no idea how to contribute. I tried to lookagreeable, often looking in his direction and nodding as he talked. Bruce would often emphasise a pointby smiling; it didn’t beam like Elliot’s. It was a forced, almost excruciating looking facial expression. Itcould, in some circles, be described as gurning. I was always happy to be there. It was a free meal withcopious rounds of coffee/beer, paid for by the company. I was of the mindset that, given the optionsavailable on the menu, I should order the most expensive. Bruce was too engaged with the client towork that one out, which was nice.Out of all of the business deals that Bruce had wined and dined for. In his 2 years at K.J.Ross &Associates he contributed to the success of 2 work orders. All other business deals were signed becauseof Kelvin’s, the owner, reputation.It was my turn to play host for the evening. I met up with Elle at Circular Quay. We enjoyed a relaxing“cruise” on the Manly Ferry Service, across Sydney Harbour to Manly. The sun shone, the reflectivequality of the sea made itself known like a beacon atop a freshly painted lighthouse. As we docked, Icalmly looked over to Elle to prompt our departure. We held hands and gently strolled onto thepontoon, narrowly avoiding the attention seeking seaside convenience stores.Life Turned Upside Down56 of 156I had no clue where to eat in Manly. I knew of Cole’s, home of the bagged half chicken. Ben Bry Burger,undoubtedly the best burger takeaway in Sydney. Ocean World Restaurant, packed a John Dory andChips to die for. All of these choices weren’t, as one would see it, suitable for a romantic sit-down meal.Thankfully, Elle was happy to take lead. With a good eye for eateries, she pointed out an Italianrestaurant across the road from Manly Wharf. We carefully crossed and took a seat outside, enjoyingthe fresh, warm seaside air.Elle and I communicated effectively through kisses, hand-holding and warm embraces. Conversationcould be best described as jerky. Elle was much more intelligent than me. She talked rapidly,academically and politically; I had to be switched on to appreciate her view point. She was a final yearuniversity politics student grappling concepts that were unfathomable to me, the layman. She wouldoften aim her ideas and her theories at me. Not having studied or discussed my political views much inthe past, I was a novice. I was unsure how to respond to her views. So, I chose to look as attentive as Icould, and hope Elle would change the subject. I chose not to change the direction of the conversation.I’m not sure she would have appreciated my knowledge of automobiles, passed down to fromengineering family. I’m not sure my closed question “did you know that Ford’s Escort RS Cosworthshares the same chassis as a Ford Sierra?”, would have flowed on nicely from Elle’s “Do you thinkresidents of our state are free to engage in any business they choose?”Ford, the car manufacturer, does have a footing in Australian culture with its gas guzzling family saloon,the Falcon and Commodore respectfully. By the time I had reached their shores, both Ford and Holdenwere on fighting terms with engine power output. The beefy aging V8 engines of both vehicles werebeing tuned to within an inch of their lives by their respective in-house tuning companies FSV and HSV(SV meaning Special Vehicles). Both had models that could easily top 400 bhp, which lead to very quickacceleration times and serious, serious noise. I loved the sound of the Aussie V8s from Ford and Holden.The tone was like the growl of a beast amplified to 11. The look of these vehicles too, set apart fromtheir standard siblings with boxier wings, bonnet and boot gave them the muscle that would make themunmistakeable on the open road. They were Australia’s mobile cod-piece extender. I loved everythingabout them, minus the emissions and fuel consumption. By jingo they even had a UTE (short for utility)version of each “mad” special vehicle. Given the space in the back, it would suit any nut job that neededto transport their flock or building materials at speed, with little care whether the contents of the bootwould be in one piece at the destination.Elle and I sat outside the Italian Restaurant as dusk settled in. We had enjoyed a relaxing eveningtogether. We split the bill before strolling towards the Esplanade, hand in hand. Elle enthusiasticallyasked if she could see the Manly flat share. I didn’t share her enthusiasm. A number of factors could fuckup the possible scenario: fleas, big cat shits, a bohemian French lady and an English stoner. I tried not toshow my true feelings. Instead I nodded like a cheap miniature toy dog on a car dashboard. “Yeah, I’llhave to show you the place” I said unenthusiastically.Elle and I stood at the entrance to the block of flats. I tentatively inserted the door key and applied mybody weight to prize the door open. I turned the stairwell light on and walked up the flight of stairs tothe front door of the apartment. Another key turn, another jolt and we were in. I flicked on the hallwaylight, paused and listened. The flat was deserted. I looked back at Elle with a grin on my face indicatingmy relief. We walked towards the kitchen. Uncharacteristically, there wasn’t any signs of cat shit. What Life Turned Upside Down57 of 156lay between Elle and I and my bed room were a few strips of flea-bitten carpet. Any flea bites could beavoided if we were swift.The door to my room required a good dose of WD40. It creaked like a 18th Century pirate ship. Onceinside the bedroom with door closed, we were safe from the elements. With a guest in tow I looked atmy room in a more judgemental light. It was barely fit for someone who was accustomed to livingwithout a home, let alone an IT Professional. Thankfully, Elle looked happy.Elle confidently walked around the bed. She ran her fingers on the light bed sheets that were untidilyarranged on the mattress. She perched herself on the end of the bed, inviting me a look which could betranslated to: Fuck me here. Fuck me now. A number of thoughts went through my head: “Great, theapartment has not put the fear of god in her”, “I hope I can sexually perform, remember last time?”I took no time in finding her first erogenous zone, the back of her neck, which I kissed. She begansucking my penis. Elle’s technique was unique: She twisted her mouth, lightly gritted her teeth andslurped. It felt great, but I was only slightly stimulated.In the game of sex, it was my time to serve. I worked my way from Elle's neck down to her vagina. Ichecked the state of my penis as I continued licking her other erogenous zone. I wasn’t erect and I wasbeginning to become stressed. I had no reason why I was experiencing erectile dysfunction. Elle hadperformed well, but it just wasn’t going to be enough that night. As I continued to go down on her I,again, had to improvise. Not being able to use my flaccid penis, I used the next best appendage, myfingers. I used my digits like a button-bashing video game. Given grit and stamina, I finger fucked Elle.The pace slowed. Both of us looked at each other. The sweat streamed down our faces as we caught abreath. Elle was beaming, exclaiming “I’ve never come 3 times before!” We didn’t get a great deal ofsleep that night. We were too busy exploring each other's bodies. When we were both wide awake webegan chatting. I lay back, with the back of my head firmly against the pillow. Elle lay on her front andrested her head on her hands. She began small talk, “that night was special” she said. She described herpast sexual highlights, passing out with ecstasy on one occasion. She excitedly pointed out that she hadnever come 3 times before. She lay on her back and shuffled her body close to mine. Facing me sheagain exclaimed “3 times!”Elle said she was concerned about my erectile dysfunction. “The first time we slept together I acceptedyou may have had issues having sex, I senses it was your first time in a while.” Elle said. “Given we’vebeen close for a while now, that shouldn’t be the case. Don’t you find me attractive?”, Elle said. Iremoved all doubt she may have had by quickly responding, “No!”. At that moment I felt alone, I didn’thave an answer to “why?” I thought back to the last time I had sex without issues. I was 26, mycolleagues and I were enjoying a weekend of excess in Prague. I had sex with a prostitute in a penthouseapartment. It was very easy to perform sexually, but why? What was it about the encounter with theprostitute that sexually excited me? Why didn’t Elle sexually excite me? Elle, as cute as she was, and asgood a sexual technique she had, I did not find sexually attractive. What I found sexually attractive hadbeen skewed during my adult life thanks to pornography. I could no longer relate to normal sexualintercourse.When I was with Elle, I didn't think I had problems of a sexual nature. I had never constructed an answeras to why I had a problem. She looked concernedly at me and told the story of a male friend of hers. He Life Turned Upside Down58 of 156discovered that he was gay. Elle suggested to me to go see a doctor. With that, she got changed and left.My mind was scrambled, I felt frustrated, confused and elated at the same time. I made my girlfriendorgasm 3 times, but didn’t penetrate her. What the hell was wrong with me? Was I the only person outthere to have this problem? I thought only the old suffered from erectile disorders. Why was it me? Iwas 30, in the prime of my life.Whenever Elle texted, she would ask if I had contacted the doctors. Thanks to her relentless prompting Ifinally built up the courage to contact the Manly Practice GP to book a consultation. That dreaded daycame, a day to swallow my pride and enter the GP’s reception. I walked up to the information desk andwhispered my name to the receptionist. She asked, “please take a seat Mr Clarke, the GP will be withyou soon.” I felt anxious. I ran my hand over my brow wipe away the sweat. I looked at the coffee tablein front of me. I couldn’t even entertain reaching for a recent copy of a donated Car Magazine. I lookedup at the clock on the wall and watched the seconds hand rotate through a full 360 degrees. I reallywished something would happen right here, right now, to suspend this moment for another… lifetime.“Mr Clarke?”, a voice said. I looked around to see a short lady, loud in voice with a distinctive Asian tingeto her Australian accent. I clambered to my feet and walked into her office. The room was a regularoffice with a simple operating bed. Doctor Chan asked me to take a seat and explain why I wanted to seeher. I cleared my throat, looked up and saw Doctor Chan with a clipboard, pen and paper. She affordedme her complete attention. I paused to organise my thoughts, building up the courage to speak to acomplete stranger. I feared that whatever was going to be said would be covering new ground and maylead to a reassessment of my life as a whole. No pressure.I cleared my throat, “Well… I am having issues…”, I got to the point, “I cannot keep an erection.” Ipaused, my heart racing. “How long have you had these issues for?” Doctor Chan asked. I was nottrusting enough to mention specifics. “Erm, this has been an issue for a while”, I replied. Ms Chancontinued with the questioning, “How many sexual partners have you had?” I felt a deep-seatedembarrassment by the answer I was about to give, “5”, I said. “Have you had any sexual encounters withmen?” Ms Chan asked. Being asked point blank if I had homosexual encounters shocked me. I paused toabsorb, hesitating as I answered a question about my sexuality, “…no!?” . With all questions asked, MrsChan began delivering her recommendations: “See a sexual health officer to chat further about yourfeelings”. “If you would like, I can offer a prescription of Viagra”, she said. I thanked her for her advice. Ideclined the medication, but did take a business card detailing the sexual health officer.I made my way to the sights, sounds and smells of Manly’s esplanade. I looked at the contact card thatDoctor Chan had handed to me. I chewed my bottom lip, looked away and back again at the card details.I was angry with myself. Why is my sexuality not straight forward? What is wrong with me? I was findingit frustrating to come to terms with a perception of me that might not be heterosexual. What was I? Ifound women attractive. Women sexually stimulated me. I found men attractive. They made my heartrace, but didn’t sexually stimulate me. I never desired sleeping with men. I did try to contact the sexualhealth worker; unfortunately, I didn’t get through the single time I tried.The communications between me and Elle were tense in the days and weeks after our night in Manly.Thankfully, it was leading up to Australia Day (celebrated annually on 26 January, marking theanniversary of the 1788 arrival of the First Fleet of British ships). There was much fan fair that day.Climate-wise it was a great time to be in Australia. It was the middle of summer, being in Sydney, it washumid. The Sydney-siders celebrated Australia Day by: Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol (a Life Turned Upside Down59 of 156common theme for all public holidays) and listening to Triple J Radio. Triple J Radio played the top 100Australian Chart Music tracks of the previous year.Early in the morning I received a text from Elle. She asked what my plans were on 26th Jan. Me, lackingany close network of friends at that point, had nothing organised. She asked if I wanted to meet her andher friends in Annandale for Australia Day celebrations. I sat up in my derelict bed and texted her backwith a resounding “YES!”. I had a look out the ajar bedroom window. The cool breeze lightly filteredthrough. The humidity was draining. All I wanted to do was rest. With that thought, I lay down. I reachedfor my cheap guitar and began playing my signature melody, Metallica’s Nothing Else Matters. The tunerequired very little effort. Best of all it didn’t require a plastic pick (well not for the first part). I stared atthe high ceiling as I played. It was so peaceful in the Manly flat, neither a French or Southern Englishaccent to be heard. I could have lay there all day.Before I knew, morning had passed and it was soon approaching leave time to meet with Elle andfriends. I submerged into the walk-in-wardrobe to find garments to suit the humid conditions. I wantedto satisfy the needs of the bloody humid conditions. What better clothes to wear than my holidayensemble consisting of thongs, white cargo shorts and a singlet (vest). It was a style that Australians hada name for, the bogan (unsophisticated person). At the time I was unaware my frowned uponappearance as I made my way towards the buzz of Manly Esplanade. Manly Esplanade hummed to thesound of pretention on the weekends. On Australia Day the pretention and buzz were amplified to awhole new level. The money that drinking establishments make on Australia Day is extraordinary.I made a bee-line for the ferry across the Wharf which took me onto Circular Quay. I was able to get outmy new iPhone and do what many a generation have done since, ask it for directions. At the time Igawped at the iPhone’s high-tech functionality. It’s ability to locate my every step using the globalpositioning system (GPS) is amazing. Locate me, locate Annandale, directions. A bus and a walk were itsrecommendations. So that’s what I did. On the bus I constantly checked my Phone. Are we there yet? Ihad some idea of where to depart. The exact location was described in Elle’s text.I hurriedly exited the bus and stared at my phone as it pointed me in the direction of a series ofapartments, much like Elle’s place. I got to the front door, double checked the address in Elle’s text andpressed the doorbell. Elle appeared at the door immediately. She looked me up and down. Her look senta mixture of signals, one of disgust and joy. I should have been more sensitive to her reaction to myappearance. I continued as normal nonetheless. We walked up the steep hallway staircase to the frontdoor of her friend’s apartment. As we approached, I could hear the buzz of social drinking. The dooropened. I was confronted by a young ginger haired man dressed in a polo shirt with a beer in his hand.He put the beverage down and reached out and delivered a firm hand-shake. He introduced himself“George, make yourself at home”.George and Elle went way back. He began telling stories of when Elle and George were in senior school.He described the heated debates that were part of after-school politics sessions. I was to find out thatGeorge was the school’s debating champion. My child-like mind immediately thought of somethinghumorous, in this instance it was a play on words, master & debater, masturbator. It was a defencemechanism, in an attempt to feel superior. I could clearly sense there was a spark between George andElle. They talked politics and finished each other's sentences. It was difficult not to feel jealous.Life Turned Upside Down60 of 156George walked over to the balcony leaving me and Elle together on the landing. She looked at me andsaid “why couldn’t you wear a collared T-Shirt? You look like a bogan.” I didn’t mean to offend. I worewhat I felt was comfortable from my restrictive wardrobe. My white singlet didn’t raise an eyebrowduring my east coast trip. However, being surrounded by tourists not in touch with the intricacies ofAustralian culture, I was able to pull it off. I looked bemused. I didn’t really know what a bogan was.Given the context and tone of Elle’s voice, it wasn’t something I should be proud of.I still craved Elle’s embrace, even though we weren't on the best of terms, I hugged her. She meltedagainst my body and we kissed. Her angst soon softened as she loosened her grip and walked towardsthe kitchen. She opened up the fridge revealing a raft of alcoholic beverages including: wine and ice-coldbottles of Peroni. It was light and gassy, which confirmed to Aussie standards. There was a level ofprestige associated with European beers. Having drunk European beers all my adult life, I wantedsomething different. I looked deeper into the bowels of the fridge. I wanted something cold, dark, flatand Australian. I knew the answer was going to be no before I asked. “any James Squire Winter, DarkLimited-Edition in here?” I said, pulling out a Peroni. Using the ridiculous bottle opener on the bottom ofmy flip flops (thongs) I prised the lid off. After extracting the grit from top of the bottle I made my wayto the balcony where a group of Elle’s mates sat.The balcony overlooked the main street, with views of nothing much other than other houses. Georgemade himself pride and place, sat on the wall in the corner. A slim, young woman of no more than 17years old sat in front of him holding a glass of wine. She was friendly, asking personal questions. I hadspoken to so many people since I’d arrived, asking the same sets of questions. Answers were easy to reeloff, but weren’t delivered with the same enthusiasm that she deserved. As with most Australians, shewas miffed to find out that I wasn’t Scottish or Irish. Australians do not expect an English person to havea Midlands accent.It was George’s time to talk. He, like most Australians, was well-versed in politics. He talked about thestate of Australian politics, comparing and contrasting them with current UK politics. I found it difficultto follow his line of conversation and add any value. I found it embarrassing, I was an ambassador for mycountry, he knew more about UK politics that I did.Elle became the centre of the conversation. She talked in great depth about her political views oncurrent affairs. George and Elle would take turns presenting their point of view. It was like watching amusical duet talk politics. I continued drinking the bottle of Peroni that was beginning to warm.Australians would often berate the English (or Pomms as they lovingly called us) for drinking warm beer.In Australian culture, drinking beer that was above 1 degrees C was frowned upon.The slim, young woman turned the sound up on the radio. Triple J radio station blurted itsannouncement of the top 10 of the top 100. I had not recognised a single track up to this point. A fewmore beers and some more chat about my homeland came to an abrupt stop. The number 1 track of2009 was about to be announced. After the expected tense build up, it came as no surprise to find outthat UK band Mumford and Sons had the top spot. I hadn’t a clue who they were at the time.After the announcement I looked at the time and began making my excuses to leave to the group. Ishook everyone’s hand and thanked them for being great company. I made my way with Elle to the frontdoor. "Dave, I think it would be a good idea if we end our relationship” she said with a heavy heart. Itfelt somewhat shocking, but then again, we weren’t compatible. I was intellectually inferior and couldn’t Life Turned Upside Down61 of 156satisfy her sexually. She then followed up with a bemusing question, “do you want to be fuck buddies?”.A fuck buddy relationship is one purely about sex, no relationship strings attached. Unsurprisingly, Ideclined. I felt we needed a break; distance makes the heart grow fonder. With a heavy heart I made myway back to Manly.The water at the Sydney Harbour Heads was as flat as a pancake. The sun reflected off the majestic,waterbound skyscraper, an oceanliner moored up at Circular Quay. Elle, had her Aunty’s car at herdisposal for the course of the weekend. She wanted to play tourist guide and show me the BlueMountains our west. I happily obliged, the Blue Mountains are one of the must-see attractions availablefrom Sydney. I felt uneasy about meeting Elle; it had been a couple of weeks since we last saw eachother.The drive in the luxurious Toyota Prius was smooth. Triple J radio was chosen, turned up a notch andsung along to by Elle. It was warm inside the car. The windows were down, allowing a flow of cool-ish airinto the cabin. We stopped at a set of traffic lights. Out of the heavens a Huntsman Spider (Australia’scommon house spider with a leg span of up to 5”) appeared, landing on the windscreen. This one wasn’ta juvenile and it wasn’t loving the outdoors. It raced towards the open passenger window where I wassitting. It was like a scene from Indiana Jones; Harrison Ford only just managed to grab his hat beforethe stone entrance slams shut. I managed to operate the electric window, just quick enough to stop themighty Huntsman from making its way onto my lap. Huntsman Spiders are renowned for hiding away inthe crevice of the car’s sun visor.Elle stopped the car at special service station. It served fuel for both the car and people with a sweettooth. The sweet shop was huge. It held every kind of confectionary an Australian could ask for. It evensold a selection of UK sweets at extortionate prices. Elle gave her recommendations, which I happilyfollowed.Sitting in the car, my hand was deep into the white, paper bag of sweets. I chomped away at the large,multi-coloured gelatinous snake like a possessed kookaburra. Elle asked if she could try one. She wasn’ta confident driver, to not distract her from her view of the road I hung the snake in front of her mouth.It looked erotic, and Elle played up to it, using her tongue and teeth to tease it from my grip.There were many viewpoints to park the car and appreciate the expanse of the Blue Mountains. Thereason for its name is because of the blue hue that the eucalyptus trees release. It’s a good 50 miles toreach the Blue Mountains from Sydney. On a clear day it is possible to see the city’s sky scrapers.Elle and I decided to explore the forest canopy a little further. The Blue Mountains funicular, thesteepest in the Souther Hemisphere, was more thrilling than the environment we descended into. Theslow-moving cable car allowed us to absorb more of the landscape and return us back to the mountainhigh. We walked a selection of trails. We decided to focus less on our surroundings and more onhumorous photo poses. Elle began proceedings, perched on a rock, sitting cross legged with the backs ofher palms on top of her knees. I followed, copying and arguably looking more ridiculous with my efforts.It was a really enjoyable day. Unfortunately, it would be last time I would see Elle.

## Chapter 8

### Meet the Expat Community

Dan Allam, the British expat, was becoming a close friend of mine. He kindly offered to share his sociallife with me, which added substance to my life in Australia. Without Dan, there would be no:• Dragon boat racing event.• Friends in the British expat community.• Flat in Rose Bay.Firstly, what is Dragon Boat Racing? Think of a long canoe consisting of 12 people. Each person sportinga paddle, paddling gracefully in unison, coordinating with the cox, a small fella located at the rear of theboat. When Dan, in passing, mentioned the annual corporate Dragon boat racing competition, he didn’tmention what was going to be involved. It wasn’t going to be a matter of turning up, grabbing an oarand whacking the water as quickly as possible. No, it was going to take a gruelling training regime atleast twice a week after work.The main organiser of the E*Trade Dragon Boat Racing effort was an Aussie lady named Helen. Her andher long-term partner were members of the local paddle boat club. They sure knew a thing or two aboutthe art of paddling. They also managed to acquire a cox. Someone who was supposedly the cat’swhiskers of the Dragon Boating amateur scene. This tiny, bald fellow was definitely vocal. During ourtraining sessions over in Paramatta, he organised our team. He supposedly knew what competition wewould be facing on the day of the race. After a number of training sessions, he mentioned "you guys areup there with the best. We have a good chance of winning if we paddle at our best”.It was a bright, calm morning over at Darling Harbour. I didn’t know what to expect on my arrival. All Idid know was I had to meet the rest of the team in the designated “financial teams area”. As I roundedthe corner, I took in the view of Darling Harbour. It was alive with activity; there were oars and singletclad athletes dressed in their financial institution’s colours. Dragon boats of varying oriental designswere parked side-by-side. Surprisingly, there was a huge turnout by the general public to see thisspectacle. and a huge spectator turnout.My eyes were the size of saucers as I walked through the participant area. As the epicness of the eventbecame apparent, I felt nervous. Thankfully the stress ebbed away as I saw the white T-Shirts of theE*Trade teams. I went over to speak to the E*Trade Team Captain, Helen. She was glad I had turned up,we now had a full complement of team members. Helen asked me for my T-Shirt size. I repliedautomatically, “Medium”. She handed me the signature E*Trade sports T-Shirt. The T-Shirt had seenbetter days, having been recycled from other events. Helen explained what the format of the day’sDragon Boat Racing Event was going to be. She explained what time the E*Trade team was due at thestart line. It was nerve racking to say the least. It was a competition and one where we could potentiallywin hands down. Well, that’s what our experienced cox iterated during our practice sessions.We all sat at the side lines; the early morning sun was beginning to envelope the harbour. All I couldthink of when the sun’s rays began to touch my skin was the Australia sun cream application mantra,“slip, slop, slap”. I reached into my bag and applied the factor 50 as the event started. Looking at ourcompetition I felt intimidated. Many of the teams consisted of huge, well built, muscular, Herculeanexamples of humans. The waters in which they paddled foamed an unearthly bright white wash. I Life Turned Upside Down63 of 156couldn’t help but look at the rest of our team members like lambs to the slaughter. My inner monologuespoke, “we’re going to get annihilated”. All teams looked frighteningly good. I felt confused; a picture ofthe confident cox entered my head. “Why the hell was our cox so confident?!” I thought. Maybe I wasoverreacting. What seemed like impressive dragon boat performances, wasn’t.The litmus test would be our first event. We walked over to the pontoon where we would enter ourboats. Team members projected words of motivation as we sat on the starting line, side-by-side withother teams. As the boats were carefully lined-up, we looked ahead, readied our oars and awaited forthe sound of the klaxon.“HONK!” We were under way, but we weren’t paddling in unison. I felt I was in step with the beat set bythe cox. Unfortunately, the person behind me was not, but the person in front was. My oar was hittingthe oar behind; it was more a joust than a paddle. I re-adjusted; we were wasting energy. It was the firsttime we were able to measure our progress against the competing teams, as we looked right and left.There was less of a difference between the teams' positions than I originally thought. As we continued, Irealised our boat was slowly inching backwards. It was more “foot-ing” backwards. We crossed thefinishing line and proceeded to dig our oars in to the water to decelerate.My team mates helped me out of the canoe; we looked at each other to gauge our efforts.Despondency was shown on the faces of everyone. “Where did we finish?” I wondered. We waited forthe organiser's announcement. Much to the surprise of all, we finished fifth. Given there were oarsynchronisation problems during the race, we could improve. We had hope, maybe we could finishhigher in the next races.We were called up again. Round 2. This time we were less nervous and more focussed. Having learnt ourlessons from the previous round we sat in the boat, ready for the sound of the klaxon, <HORN!> We setoff at a blistering pace. All of our paddlers were in sync. I watched the competition to my right.Surprisingly, we were edging backwards again at an even quicker rate than in the previous round. Whatwas going on?! We crossed the finishing line. We gave it our all, but I felt a sinking sensation in mystomach. The announcement came... “In sixth position is Team E*Trade”. With that, we were out of thecompetition. The only race left was the one for the wooden spoon. We came 5th in that, which wentsome way to mend our broken egos. Overall, it was embarrassing. The team was happy to go theirseparate ways even before the winners were announced. At least it was a sunny day. Unfortunately, thesun didn’t shine on our fortunes.Life Turned Upside Down64 of 156Dan knew I was on the lookout for a new abode. I would often moan about my current living situationwith Flo and the cats. One day, in passing, Dan mentioned his friend, Carl, was moving out of a flatshare. The flat share was located in the beautiful and relatively expensive suburb of Rose Bay. Danforwarded me an email with details of the accommodation. I perused the details, noting the details ofthe flatmate, Becky. The apartment offered views of Sydney Harbour bridge. It was relatively expensivethough, a good couple of hundred dollars per month pricier than the flat in Manly. It didn’t deter me. Iwanted out of Flo’s.I emailed Becky, who replied quickly. She wanted to set a meet up at the flat at the earliest opportunity.“Splendid”, I thought. How difficult could a viewing be? On the weekend I arrived at the flat. I wassurprised to be met by Carl, the flat mate leaving, who warmly invited me in. As I entered, I quicklylooked at the interior. My first thoughts were “small, but how much space do I honestly need?”. Thekitchen was a separate room, located close to the entrance. The living space was large. It was a diningroom and lounge combined. I was led to the balcony that had space for a table and 4 chairs. I was askedto take a seat. I looked to my right. In the distance was a view of Sydney Harbour Bridge. Carl asked if Iwould like a beer. With jaw ajar, eyes fixated on the beautiful view, I nodded. Time seemed toaccelerate as the sun's rays danced on the continuous sea. I barely noticed Carl’s flat mate, Becky. Shesat opposite me on the table. I found out she was a day older than my good self. She had long straightblack hair, a petite stature and complexion as white as snow. She had a proper British accent that was insexy, measured and clear.Carl arrived back to the balcony table with 2 bottles of Victoria Bitter. A beer for him and me. As he satdown the meet and greet turned into a formal interview. Carl played friendly cop, while Becky’s tone ofvoice indicated concern. She fired off the first question, “Tell me about yourself?”. I immediately felt offguard. I hesitated; my hands felt clammy. I thought hard to formulate a formal answer. Having answeredthis question many times in an informal setting, people generally asked:• Who are you?• Why are you here?• What are you drinking?After a lot of practice I had my answers perfected. I was a 30-year-old bloke from Birmingham. I wasforced to leave my previous role because the IT department flagged a porn video on my work laptop. Inever felt comfortable saying the previous sentence. Instead I mentioned the job offered theopportunity to travel and I could earn good money too.Weirdly Carl was talking the most. He didn’t seem bothered asking me personal questions. He appearedhappy with my personality. He used the interview to joke with “serious” Becky and lighten the mood.Becky asked one final question, “how soon can you move in?” I didn’t have a clue what the notice periodwas at the Manly flat. I had no tenancy agreement documentation to reference. I took a guess, stating amonths notice. This answer was foot noted with, “let me chat to my flat mate before I give you adefinitive answer.” Anyway, April was looking likely.Carl looked at my empty beer bottle and asked if I wanted another. I took my phone out to gauge thetime. It was getting late. I wanted to make sure I caught the last Manly ferry from Circular Quay in plentyof time. I stood up and apologised for cutting the meeting short. They both smiled, I reciprocated and Life Turned Upside Down65 of 156walked towards the flat entrance. Carl and Becky took turns to shake my hand before I left. As I walkedto the bus stop, I felt happy with how the interview went.The following day around lunch time I received a text from Becky. Was my gut feel right? Did I get atenancy offer? “Thanks for your time yesterday. Carl and I very much enjoyed your company and believeyou make a great fit for the flat”, read the text. I smiled, replying, “I would be very happy to move in. Letme speak to my flat mate and ask when I would be able to leave.”I’d only been living at the Manly flat for 3 months. Before I moved in, I said to Flo that I would be stayingfor 6 months minimum. I was desperate. I shuddered at the thought of living out of a suitcase, movingfrom one hostel to another. I looked at my living situation now. I had stability, but, like my job, I didn’twant to be loyal to one place. The only issue I had was an awkward legal one, leaving a contract early. IfI could talk to Flo and agree on a suitable move date that would suit her and meet Becky’s needs, thatwould be splendid.The “meeting” that I had with Flo about moving out was less a conversation, it was more an altercation.She made me feel nervous. When I’m nervous I’m blunt, flustered and defensive.I sat in the Manly flat kitchen seeing to my salty chicken supper. I could hear a door clunking, andbanging. Someone had arrived. Given the signature sound, it was Flo. She walked hurriedly into thekitchen. Her curly, long, black, voluminous hair moving like a slinky. It wasn’t the best time to catch her,she looked angry. I didn't have a choice; I rarely saw her; “Hi Flo, I saw a new flat during the week.” I saidhurriedly. She stopped briefly to look in her bag and empty out its contents onto the lounge table. Anirascible, French accented noise exited from her mouth. I continued “the flat is over in Rose Bay. It has abeautiful view of the Sydney Harbour bridge. Best of all it’s available to move into in 2 weeks.”Flo had my cash deposit money, which I gave to her, trusting she would officially deposit it. She neverdid. So, I had no confirmation of the bond and no rental agreement documentation for the Manlyproperty. Officially there was no check out schedule. I asked “How much notice do I need to provide if Iwanted to move out?” Flo’s attention moved quickly from her bag and towards me. She stared at me insilence. Her attention moved back to her bag, “didn’t we agree you would be staying for 6 months?” shesaid quietly. I sheepishly looked at her. Flo’s tone changed. She was clearly angry, “since you’ve movedin you’ve done nothing to help. You don’t clean the communal area and I barely see you around.” I triedto retaliate. “What about the fleas Flo? We have fleas all over the carpet.” I said. Give her calm reaction,she knew of the issue. What I wasn’t ready for was the excuse she was about to deliver. “They’re housefleas” she replied. Holy shit, of all the excuses a person could use, that was up there with the nuttiest.“House fleas?!” I said with a perplexed expression on my face. I might have accepted “they’re part of theFlea Circus that is about to end its world tour”, but Flo’s excuse was pathetic. She put a close to theconversation “now is not a good time. We’ll talk about this tomorrow. I need to get ready for work.” shehuffed.Flo scurried away, slamming her bedroom door closed. I was left in the lounge, heart racing, feelingnone the wiser about my living situation. I was in no mood to finish my half chicken, chips and salad.After taking a deep breath I assessed the situation. How did I get my deposit back and end my tenancyearly? I had no clear answer. Thankfully, my ravenous appetite had returned. It was time to wolf downthe salty chicken!Life Turned Upside Down66 of 156My precious deposit was Flo’s bargaining tool. The next day as I took my Manly Ferries commute to thecity, it’s all I thought about. The verbal agreement that lasted all of a sentence when I first moved in, itmeant nothing. I didn’t have a clue what my rights were and what my next steps should be.I entered the E\*Trade office to see Dan, beaming as always. “How are you this fine morning Mr.Clarke?”, he bellowed. I avoided eye contact and gave a forlorn “I’m alright.” I knew well that theresponse I wanted to give would require a lot of time to answer. Dan was perceptive; he was very skilledat reading into small changes in a person’s body language. I was an open book, and one with very fewpages. “You don’t seem your usual self, what’s up? Is it lady trouble?”, he said. “Kind of. I took a look atthe flat you mentioned. I loved it. Great little place. Becky and Carl are really nice. I would love to movein at the earliest opportunity. The flat in Manly is a shit hole. The problem is, my land lady. I verballyagreed with her back in January that I would be staying for at least 6 months. I know a verbal agreementisn’t worth anything. I have paid a deposit which, Flo, the landlady has in her possession. How do I goabout leaving the flat and still keep my deposit?” I stressed.Dan was on it. He Googled "tenant’s rights in Australia”. “It looks like you as a tenant have many rights.It says here, if you haven’t signed any agreement you just need to give written notice. Your deposit issafe; I can write a letter for your landlady if that helps?” he said. “Yeah, sure, that would be great.”, Ireplied. This caring side Dan was showing, I hadn’t seen before. “There”, he said, handing me a letterfresh from the computer printer. “Have a read of that, I can update it if need be. If it looks good givethat to your landlady and see what she has to say.” Dan said boldly. I looked at the print like it was agolden ticket to Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. I beamed as I read out my rights as a tenant. “This isbrilliant Dan, thanks very much.”I now felt happier with the flat situation, knowing my rights as a tenant. I got back to the flat after a longday. I walked sheepishly into the kitchen, pulled out my golden ticket and placed it carefully on thekitchen table top. I looked down at it. An element of doubt entered my head. The “What-Ifs” began toplay in my head. I lay in bed and looked blankly at the high ceiling. This place I called home; I wasbeginning to divorce myself from. I wanted to move into the Rose Bay flat immediately. With all goodthings, I had to wait, for Flo.The next morning, I walked into the kitchen. I noticed the letter that Dan had crafted was missing fromthe counter. I looked around. “Could it have fallen on the floor?”, I whispered to myself. I avidlysearched, nothing. I felt nervous, the “What-Ifs” began to play again in my head. I wasn't lookingforward to the next meeting with Flo.After a day at the office I returned to the Manly flat. As I entered, I could hear the unmistakeable,hurried presence of Flo. As I walked towards the kitchen, I then caught a glimpse of the barbaric, blackcurls of her hair. Nervousness hit me. I made my way wearily towards her. I tenuously greeted her, “HiFlo”, I said. Flo cocked her head to look at me and exhaled heavily through her flared nostrils.The one-sided conversation began. “So, I found your letter”, Flo said firmly. ‘Cool, I hope she read andagreed with it all.’, I thought. She continued with a question. “Did you know that my boyfriend works inthe police force?”, she asked. I thought briefly about this closed question. The answer that initiallypopped into my head was “yes, but what does that have to do with the letter?”. I took a deep gulp andtried to speak calmly. “Errr, no”, I replied. This was an obvious lie. The volume of and pace of Flo’s voiceincreased markedly. “How dare you write something like this!”, she exclaimed. The last time I had Life Turned Upside Down67 of 156experienced a dressing down like this was at senior school. The teacher read a joke in the back of myEnglish Language book; the punchline was “mega-sore-arse". She paused, with hands on hips and a gazefixed on me she said, “I will not be giving you your deposit back, plain and simple.” With that she left thekitchen area and slammed her bedroom door.‘Well, that could have turned out better… ‘, I thought. That was it then, I could leave early. If I did, mydeposit would be staying. I sighed deeply. I seeked comfort, which for me meant food. Not just any food,I needed a special BenBry Burger meal. I was in luck. It was Thursday, which meant the all-day specialwas available: Benbry Burger, chips, sauce and soft drink for a wallet-tickling AU\$12.I sat outside Benbry Burger in the company of the seagulls and the Thursday special. The crash of thewaves on the shores of Manly Beach brought a feeling of calm. I wanted to savour this moment. I bitslowly into the sumptuous, sweet tasting Benbry Burger. I sighed, reclined and smiled. A positivethought popped into my head, ‘forget about the deposit, it’s time to move on’.Dan invited me for a drink in Manly, with him and his expat mates one sunny afternoon. Up until thatpoint I had socialised with a people of varying nationalities, mainly British and Australian. Of thosepeople, Dan was my closest friend. I didn’t realise I lived in a bubble back in the UK. I found it easier tosocialise with others from my home country. The European Sydney-siders shared the same culturalreference points, a common language and many historical references. The difference was, EuropeanSydney-siders: knew of gum trees, marsupials, huge swaths of isolated environments & temperateconditions. They were laidback, living in a class-less society. People were proud of their rebellious,convict roots.I noticed Dan standing in a drinking circle with a group of 10 people. He was chatting to a sun burned,ginger haired bloke who wore black rimmed glasses. He could have easily been mistaken for a fatversion of Chris Evans (a British TV & radio celebrity). I smiled and indicated my presence to Dan bylifting my arm in the air. He looked wide-eyed and raised his half-full pint glass. “Mr Clarke, good to seeyou made it. This is Carlos.” he said nervously. Carl smiled, transferred his pint to his other hand, andshook my hand. In a quiet British accent, he introduced himself, “Hi my name is Carl, as you know fromour brief meeting over at Rose Bay. Welcome to the British ex-pat community. Grab yourself a drink atthe outdoor bar over there. When you come back, I’ll introduce you to the rest of the gang.”, he said.The outdoor bar was situated in front of the beautiful a calm Manly sea scape. Having seen what theothers were drinking, and wanting to fit in, I ordered a common Sydney draught beer, Toohey’s New.The barman took a schooner (425ml) glass out of the fridge and began pouring. Given the humidity, colddrinks warmed quickly. I returned to Carl; he took a sip of his drink before delivering the groupintroductions.There was Andy, Johnny, Pete, Dan… Each person said hello, some even threw in a quick introduction. Ifelt comfortable around them. They showed British personality traits, reminding me of my best friend’spersonalities back in Birmingham. They didn't need to be like for like replacements of my best friends.They just needed to be English, male, my age and social drinkers.Australia would teach me the meaning of friendship: what bonded me to people and how difficult it wasto make friends. I didn’t question my interests at the time. What were they? What did I enjoy doing herein Australia? My interests were inspired by my life in the UK, especially social drinking, which I didn’t Life Turned Upside Down68 of 156realise at the time. I appreciated the taste of beer. Beer in the UK was sourer, darker and flatter thanAustralian beer. I slowly acclimatised to the refreshing taste of beer in Australia.I enjoyed laymen’s terms conversation when drinking. I was happy to let people talk. I was a goodlistener. Pubs were a great place to socialise. Alcohol is a drug that improves a person’s ability tosocialise, to talk about whatever thoughts occupy their minds. Unfortunately, the quality of the verbalcontent can degrade when the quantity is increased.Australian bars showed a range of local sports all day on big screens. Rugby League was the sport ofchoice in Sydney. Australian league rugby was arguably of higher quality that found in the UK. TheRoosters and Rabbitohs were the top 2 Sydney teams. Rugby, and sports in general, heavily influencedthe Sydney culture.I loved the evening weather in Sydney. When the sun set the temperature was perfect. The humidityhelped the heat linger. Unfortunately, the mosquitos were present as a result. The clandestine critterswere rarely bit an Aussie. The mosquitos seemed to treat an Australian as one of their own. It wascommon for Australians to mock the "Poms” lack of immunity to mosquito bites.Being a social drinker was a great excuse to get outdoors in Sydney. The average Sydney bar cateredhandsomely for those choosing to drink there. UK pubs had the beer garden with benches. Australianbars had everything bar the kitchen sink. If the entertainment was poor and the beer tasted bad, otherbar options were outstanding.The amassed group of Brits at The Manly Bar were looking more towards their watches than towardsthe next drinking venue. It suited me. I was happy to stay, home was round the corner. The first of thewatch-watchers was Dan. He’d barely touched his drink; it was obvious he didn’t want to be there. Thetext from his wife was an excellent excuse for him to begin his hour plus journey home. I continued myconversation with Carl. He had plenty to say about the new flat share with Rebecca.

## Chapter 9

### A British rose

I was so happy to be moving. I believed the new living experience would be much better than the one Iwas leaving. The cost of rent was more, but I was gaining an improved quality of life. Becky, my new flatmate, was British. It was going to be easy to talk to her without the need for me to pretext everythingwith laborious context. The flat was going to be devoid of fleas; it was going to be serviced by aprofessional cleaner once a week. The improved view, a lack of cats and a French dishevelled femalecook. The positives were numerous.The only minor issues I was facing, well initially, was a lack of furniture. I was informed the bedroomwould be unfurnished before I moved in. Having taken Carl’s advice, during drinks in Manly, I had theforesight to buy a bed prior to moving in. It was, unfortunately, going to be delivered 3 days after Iarrived. In the meantime, I had to purchase bedding. Where could I purchase high quality bedding tosuit the classier Rose Bay apartment, Myer. Myer was a high-quality Australian department store inSydney City Centre. The warm conditions would require the purchase of a light doona (duvet) andbedsheet. I also required high quality bed cushions to smother my head with feathery kisses. I had noidea of what the cost of bedding would be. After the bedding items were scanned and bagged, the totalcost was north of $100.One mistake I had made before agreeing to move in to the apartment, was not questioning the homeinternet connection. I was a big internet user, influenced by my work as an IT professional. The internetsolution in Rose Bay was based around mobile phone technology, which was very slow at the time. Onfirst use I searched the world wide web for superfast internet deals near me. Carl had described why theapartment had a mobile internet setup. It was to accommodate Becky and her need to call her family inthe UK. My superfast internet search endeavours were paying off. I found a deal that would allow: Beckyto phone home, me a fast internet connection and $5 to be saved on the monthly bill. I discussed theinternet deal with Becky, who hesitantly agreed to make the proposed switch. All in, it took 2 weeks toupgrade the service.Carl had taken his big screen TV when he moved out. This left a noticeable space on the TV stand whichneeded to be amended as a matter of urgency. After a brief chat with Becky, the conclusion was, yes, abig screen TV was a nice to have. In the interim we made do with a small TV she borrowed from herbedroom. It was going to be a matter of time before the inadequacies of the small TV and my increasedbank balance would result in me buying a new TV.Ask any Australian about ANZAC Day and they will immediately educate you on it’s significance. For theaverage British person, it won’t “ring any bells”. Should it? Funnily enough it’s significance is directlyrelated to a decision made during World War I by the British. After the educational session it is apparentthat in 1915, 25th April, the British led it’s loyal Antipodean brethren on a death march over in Gallipoli,Turkey. The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) were drafted in to fight on the GallipoliPeninsula. They were outnumbered, outgunned and were disadvantaged by their poorer strategicposition. It was the only war the Turkish forces won during WWI.After this education and a subsequent information about America’s role. America rescued Australia froma Japanese offensive in the WWII fight in the Pacific. It became clear why Australians of British descent, Life Turned Upside Down70 of 156even though they are historically connected to the motherland, feel an undertow of resentment for theBritish.ANZAC day is a public holiday in Australian and New Zealand. It occurs on April 25th, commemorating theBattle of Gallipoli in WWI. There is a togetherness in Australian society that such a day brings, which ismissing in British public holidays. The average Brit knows not of this day, and further knows not of abetting game associate with it, Two-Up! Two-Up is a simple betting game, made legal on ANZAC day atdrinking establishments across the country. It’s something that everyone should experience.It was a warm evening over in Coogee. I had arranged to meet the British Expat group and also my oldQueenscliffe flat mate, Andi Walker. The meeting place, the infamous Coogee Bay Hotel(CBH). I sayinfamous, it had featured in many negative news articles in the Sydney press on issues related todrunken disorderly behaviour. It was a huge place with a monumental outdoor seating area. I was soonto find out it had a huge indoor area too, to showcase the game of two-up.I put the effort in with my clothes that night (I wanted to avoid looking like a “dero”). On arrival to CBH Irecognised the group of expats. I thought the British men’s Expat group was significant in numbers. Thenumbers of British women exceeded that number, taking the group to the size of a small village. As Iapproached, people who recognised me began to smile and offer a shake of the hand. Cullen, agirlfriend of an expat named Andy, went above and beyond to get to know me and present me to thenew members of the group. It felt great to be accepted at a time when I was becoming home sick. Thesepeople were going to be my shoulders to cry on.Something I did question about the group was its size. How could so many people belong to one socialgroup? it was formed from three subgroups: Andy’s, Carl’s and Johnny’s friends. These fine gents hadhigh levels emotional intelligence. They were great listeners, able to interact with people of varyingpersonalities. It was clear there was an undercurrent of mounting tension between these 3 groups.Andi finally arrived. She looked stunning: tall, 6’ with heels on. She wore a commanding, huggable reddress to complement the rest of her outfit. "Dave" she shouted confidently. As I turned round to seeher, my jaw dropped. Out of my periphery I could see men appreciate her too. I was a littleembarrassed, as she approached. The unwanted attention was now drawn towards me. I nervouslysmiled.Andi was gracious in presenting herself to the group. She was not too brash as to embarrass and not toodull as to tarnish her natural sparkle. As the group settled and the appreciators retreated, I began to feelcomfortable and enjoy being in Andi’s company. I even thought, “imagine if she was my girlfriend? Howjealous would people be of me?”. After a big hug, I introduced Andi to my new, impressed friends,including: Andy, Johnny and Carl. After the introductions, Andi turned her attentions to me. Sheindicated that she wasn’t here just to see me, her other friends were sitting inside. Andi munificentlymade her excuses to leave, but left an open invitation to me. Andi announcing “hey Dave I’ll be inside ifyou want to meet up later.” “Cool” I replied. Given the lack of a group plan, and the slow dispersal of thethree sub-groups, it would be a short time before I would see Andi again.Most of the group British Ex-pats had been hanging around CBH for the whole day. As the sun slowlydipped, I was only one drink in when people began making plans to leave. I was in a sociable mood,ready to see how far I could make it into the early hours. I said goodbye to the ex-pats and made my Life Turned Upside Down71 of 156way to the indoor bar area of CBH. Inside it was equally packed with people as it was outside. I circuitedthe bar multiple times, but I couldn’t see Andi. As I took my final lap, I recognised Andi’s voice above thebar room banter, “Dave! We’re over here!” The relief hit me as I saw her by a table with her friends.I smiled, and said my hellos to the group. I hoped Andi’s mates were planning on staying at the CBH.From listening in on their conversation, thankfully this was the situation. The plan that they were aboutto agree on would be a welcome surprise. Andi’s friend Steve said, “what do you guys think about goinginto the hall and playing a game of Two-Up”. At the time I knew little of the game and had yet toexperience playing it. With a legal blind eye turned towards Two-Up today, now would be a good timefor me to try.We walked from the bar to, what only could be described as a cavernous, dark hall. Given the amount ofspace occupied by the outdoor drinking area and indoor bar, I was surprised there was room left for ahall. It took a few moments for my eyes to adjust to the low light levels. Steve, Andi and I approached alarge gathering of people holding aloft their money. We stopped and observed the action from acomfortable distance to listen and learn. We could see 2 officials with paddles of coins in a measuredspace at the centre of the crowd. “What were they doing?” I said to Steve. The penny literally droppedas game one finished. We were witnessing a game of heads and tails that generally followed these steps:1. Wait for the previous game to end.2. Shout “HEADS” or “TAILS”.3. Find a person who:a. shouted “TAILS” to your “HEADS” or vice versa.b. Wants to wager the same bet as you.4. Wait for the officials to release the coins and shout the outcome.5. Claim your winnings or give hand over your losses.After an hour of moving between the 2 betting stages, I had broken even. At that point, I stoppedbetting and watched the action on the larger stage. At one-point Andi was asked to join the officials tothrow a set of coins, much to the amusement of me and her friends. As midnight approached, I washappy to take lead and head home. It was comforting knowing I only had a short journey to my newhome in Rose Bay.I skim read an email I received from Andy Walker. The content described meeting up on the weekend. Iflagged it and re-read it days later. One incorrect assumption I had made was who the email was from. Ithought it was from my NZ lady friend Andy Walker. Nope, this was Carl’s UK male mate Andy Walker.An ex-pat I had first met in Manly. Why did this person want to contact me? Of the ex-pats, it wasJohnny and Carl that I had assumed would want to contact me. I felt honoured to be more popular.Andy reminded me of Paul McCartney, similar height, but more athletic in physique. He was a sportsenthusiast, he talked about surfing, swimming, running, snowboarding. He led a fun packed life. I washappy to reply to his email with an enthusiastic response. Andy was quick to reply, suggesting to meet atLuna Park, Milson’s Point (located the other side of Sydney Harbour Bridge), on Saturday, 26th April.Cc’d in to the email was Becky, my new flattie and Andy’s girlfriend Cullen. To make it even moreinteresting, there was mention of Cullen’s mother making an appearance too. She had arrived recentlyfrom the UK and occupied Andy and Cullen’s spare room. I was later to find out that the meet up was Life Turned Upside Down72 of 156mainly for the benefit of Cullen’s mom. Andy wanted her out the apartment. She had no home skills andexpected to be waited on hand and foot.Luna Park drew memories of yester-year. A 1930’s fairground, refurbished in 2004 to cater for tourismrelated to the Olympics games. Becky had a car and insisted on driving me and her from the Rose Bayflat to Luna Park. Andy, Cullen and Cullen’s mom aimed to meet us at the entrance. It was a gorgeousAutumn day; not a cloud in the sky. Becky and I parked nearby and walked through the ornate, circusinfluenced Luna Park entrance. We reached the peer; Becky reached for her phone in her handbag,“Andy, are you here yet?” she asked. She slowly turned, looked towards the entrance and smiled. Ifollowed the direction of her gaze. Three enthusiastic looking people, I recognised Andy and Cullen. Theother, I presumed, was Cullen’s mom. They quickened their step, reaching us with arms wide open. Thehigh levels of enthusiasm and emotion were something I wasn’t used to. In contrast, Cullen’s Momlooked grumpy. I shook Andy’s hand; I engaged Cullen and Cullen's mom with an awkward hug.I realised I was a reserved person, even by British standards. I felt awkward being in physical contactwith people. Prior to landing in Australia, I had rarely hugged or kissed people. It was something I justdidn’t do growing up; my family & friends rarely showed their emotional sides.I “released” Cullen and her mom from my awkward embrace and smiled. What do they say about firstimpressions? For me, this was less of an impression, but more a transaction. The women split off fromthe group. Andy and I began to chat away enthusiastically. On hearing Andy’s strong southern accent, Iengaged my Birmingham accent. I said “how’s it going?”. Andy replied with an upbeat tone to his voice,“yeah, not bad, not bad.” It was refreshing hearing the more British answer to that question. The Aussieamplified adjectives took the shine off the upper limits of the English language.Andy began to chat about his love for Australian outdoor activities. I thought I loved being active. Andyput me to shame. He began rattling off the list: Swimming, Surfing, Marathon Running, Mountain Biking,Snowboarding. He caught my attention with the last activity in the list. “Where can you snowboard inAustralia?” I asked. “Do you snowboard?” he replied. I tried to be modest in my response, “yeah, I’vebeen to a few resorts: Saalbach/Hinterglem in Austria; Andorra, on the border of Spain and France.” Bywinter sports enthusiast's standards, my experience was tame. I think I had spent more time at my localindoor slopes than any other venue. Out of embarrassment, I prematurely stopped my snowboarding chapter and verse. I looked over to Andy, his eyes were the size of saucers. He enthusiastically asked,“Do you fancy heading over to Thredbo? I’ve had a look at the weather recently. There is supposed to bea few inches of snow on the slopes. Failing that, they do have snow blowers to add a covering.” What afriendly and trusting bloke. I barely knew Andy, for him to invite Becky and I to Luna Park was going outthe way. For him to talk of the opportunity to snowboard in Australia. I was overwhelmed to put itlightly. With an enthusiastic, Australian inflected tone I said, “yeah, perfect.” “Cool, what’s your phonenumber? I’ll text you when I find out more.”, he replied.Andy and I turned our attention to Cullen, her mom and Becky. Cullen's mom had a rush of nostalgiawhen she saw the colourful, undulating, wooden slide that stretched many lanes, but wasn’t particularlysteep. Cullen began to smile, feeding off her mother’s excitement. “Come on, shall we have a go?”,Cullen said eagerly. Andy laughed and shrugged his shoulders, “why not, you only live once.” he said. Itwas a motto that defined him, given his already impressive life experience.Life Turned Upside Down73 of 156At the top of the slide we realised there weren’t enough lanes to fit all 5 of us. We split the groupaccording to gender. We put chivalry aside. Andy and I quickly grabbed mats and began our slide-ydescent. Andy asked the carny (slide operator), what technique delivered the best experience. “Headfirst mate” he said, which is what Andy selected. I chose the standard toes first technique, but made mybody was as aerodynamic as possible.Andy began to cackle as he lay on the hessian matt. He turned to the women and said “right could yougirls give me a push on 3?” The ambers of my competitive nature had been stoked to a warming glow. Iwaited for the countdown, which Becky took charge of. She bellowed as good as her lungs could give,“3,2,1 GO!” Andy and I got off the start quickly. Andy’s lucrative chest-to-mat positioning was provinginferior to my missionary style bum-to-mat. I began accelerating. Andy on the other hand was losingcontrol and giggling frantically. He managed to spin himself and the mat a full 360 degrees. I, conversely,glided smoothly to the huge black breaking matts at the bottom.I didn’t outwardly celebrate the win, but mentally I felt extremely pleased. Andy eventually arrived andlaughed out loud. Cullen shouted from the top of the slide “Are you all right love?”. Andy replied “yeah,all good, just a few mat burns, but that’s all.” It was the ladies turn. They all ignored the carny’s advice.They chose the conventional sit up, grip and slide. From the huge grins on their faces, it was clear theywere having a blast. All were laughing as they picked themselves and their mats up at the bottom of theslide. We continued our Luna Park tour, experiencing some of the more traditional rides including:dogems, waltzers and basketball before heading home. A great day for a once in a blue moonexperience.When you buy a car, you don’t think about how many of that car model are on the road. The same canbe said for Canadians. Dave Playford was the first Canadian I had met in Australia. I knew little of hisexpansive homeland. I discovered that Canadians are a proud people. Their cultural heritage iscelebrated, wherever in the world they are, on a day aptly named Canada Day. There were lots ofCanadians in Sydney thanks to Australia’s close links with other Commonwealth countries (This was a bigreason why I was there). Canada Day celebrations were being advertised at many of Sydney's pubs.Andi was my first true female friend. She was a trusting individual, happy to include me in her socialcircles after she split with her boyfriend Glen. Andi was positive and energised, which made her a verypopular person. My laid-back personality complemented her laid-back attitude to social drinking. OnCanada Day, June 27th, Andi was heading to a pub located near St. James’s Park, Sydney CBD, with herfriend Mel. I was hoping, much like my personality, it was going to be a relaxed evening.With it being June, the already short days were becoming shorter. It would be considered a goodweather day in any other part of the world, definitely so in Canada. I had a quick look at the entrance ofthe bar Andi had mentioned. Its theme was heavily influenced by Bavaria and North America. I walkedinside, there were lots of big screens TVs hung on walls. They were all showing various classic Canadianhockey games. Small, blue, ice buckets surrounding the bar counter. They were filled with a selection ofCanadian beers: Moosehead, Molson and Coors. These buckets could be purchased for very little, whichlent itself to an evening that may not be that relaxed after all.I saw Andi perched on the bar wearing a Canadian NHL top. She wore it well, given her svelte figure.Stood beside her, at a commanding 5’10”, was her Northern English friend Mel: Blonde, cute, curvy. Shewas the same age as Andi, but still looked young, more 30 than 37. I was magnetised to her. I knew she Life Turned Upside Down74 of 156wasn’t interested, even though she was single. From our quick chat she had a demanding job, eventorganiser. She was the type that required a man with an equally commanding job to pull her heartstrings. I was happy I didn't annoy her with my chat up lines. The only reason she didn’t leave was out ofrespect for Andi. Andi, Mel and I had fun that evening. We walked around, chatting to various groups ofCanadians, shared beers and in some cases their attire.I was forming a close friendship with Andy the expat. From our deeper conversations it was obvious hewas having second thoughts about life with girlfriend Cullen. He may not have been enjoying thecompany of Cullen, but loved the recent slushy snowboarding experience at Mount Buller. I had a blasttoo. Andy and I agreed it was time to take our snowboarding to the best slopes in the SouthernHemisphere. We had to leave the beautiful seaside scenes of Sydney and fly to a place calledQueenstown. This outdoor sports Mecca was located on the South Island of New Zealand.Andy and I took weeks to organise the trip. Andy set about getting Queenstown slightly differently tome, by shit box. He purposefully timed the visit to coincide with the arrival of a few Aussie friends offriends.I was standing in Terminal 1 at Sydney Airport. My dusty snowboarding gear, recently arrived in a hugebox from the UK, was packed away in a big bag and hold-all. This gear was going straight to theoversized luggage area. It was going to my first time flying with Air New Zealand. I was really lookingforward to it, having read about their excellent level of service in a travel article. Their in-flight safetyvideos are the funniest of any airline. As the plane began its take off, the 2010 Rugby World Cup teaminspired video played, I was captivated. By the end of the briefing I thought “those Kiwis have anawesome sense of humour”.The flight from Sydney to Queenstown was direct. I’m not one for watching out of the passengerwindow. The approach to Queenstown airport is epically beautiful; there is a small amount ofturbulence as the mountain air buffets the airplanes wings. As the mountains came into view, I couldhear the passengers deliver a cacophony of “wows”.Queenstown airport is a short car journey from town. I opted to take a taxi driven by a random SouthAmerican chap. The drive was stunning; it twisted and turned its way around the mountains. There werelaybys on the road corners; it allowed cars to park up and tourists to admire views of Lake Wakapitu. Iwas half-tempted to ask the driver to do as such. Unfortunately, I was too focussed on our conversation,one about life in New Zealand and Liverpool Football Club.

As we arrived into Queenstown I was initially underwhelmed. It was small, the David Jones store in Sydney was more formidable than the whole town. It did pack a lot into humble estate. There were many tourist centres, shops and hostels. The hostels dwarfed every other type of business. I was booked into Nomads backpackers; prior to living in Australia I had never set foot in backpacker accommodation. By the time I had arrived in Queenstown it was the accommodation of choice. Each hostel was a shared living space including: toilet, kitchen and sleeping quarters. I checked in at reception. The hostel provided me with a set of bed sheets and pillow cases. I was assigned the lower bunk of a bed in a 6 person room share. There were 3 bunk beds and enough floor space to swing a mouse by its tail.I couldn’t see the floor, such was the mess of clothes and hair dryers strewn upon it. I tippy-toed my way around the carnage to the vacant bed. I chucked my backpack underneath and headed out.
Andy text me to mention he had landed in Christchurch, picked up the "shit box" rental vehicle and was far from Queenstown. Instead of hanging around in the hostel I went into town to explore. The first feature to catch my eye was the stream that ran through the centre of town. The stream was surrounded by bars; the weirdest and most wonderous was a microbrewery pub for Mac’s Beer, a famous New Zealand brewery. My excitement grew when I entered and saw a plethora limited edition beers on tap. I paid for a paddle, a sample of all available beers. I sampled, and exited in a merrier state. Walking around town I saw a café, an adventure store, more bars and a queue of people that snaked around the building. I looked at the sign above the entrance, it read “Fergburger”. I walked up to a random person in the queue and asked, "what's this place then?". The man replied, "You've never heard of Ferg Burger? It's the best gourmet burger joint in town." The best gourmet burger I had experienced in my life had been served at Manly’s Benbry Burgers. If thta could be bettered, I would be happy to get on the next flight home. The queue was moving quickly, I was hungry and I had time on my hands. 30 minutes later I entered the small diner. There were a large number of staff members on hand, prepare and serving the big dish in a bun. I looked up at the hand written menu behind the counter. Their standard offerings included the Fergburger(beef), Cockadoodle Oink (chicken and bacon), Bun Laden (Falafel with salad) and The Codfather (blue code). Their most extreme burger was the the Big Al. He was ¾ pound of beef, lashings of bacon, a whole lot of cheese, 2 eggs, loads of salad and a big wad of aioli. Fries were at extra cost. When I received my Fergburger I did a double take. I was holding their standard size burger, with a degree of difficulty, given its large size. So big was their burger I had to plan how to eat it. I did what only a fool would attempt, to open my mouth as wide as it could and take a bite. By the time I had finished eating, my jaw muscles ached.

The hectic throb of the Queenstown highstreet made way for the serenity of Lake Wakapitu. There the boats were abundant, offering tours of the serene, expansive body of water. I paused for a minute, took a deep breath and freed my mind of thoughts. It is no wonder why New Zealanders frequently use the adjective “epic”, they are surrounded by so much natural beauty. I broke my gaze of the mountainous backdrop and focussed my attentions back to the throb of town. It was then I noticed the sculpture of the now extinct Moa bird. If only I could have seen this huge animal alive. I took another deep breath and walked towards the hostel.

I received a phone call later that day. It was Andy; he had just arrived in Queenstown, no dramas, in the shitbox rental vehicle. He asked me to meet in some obscure car park on the edge of town. As I arrived I fixed my eyes on the hire car. What a terrible car; a Nissan Fairlady, born in the 1990s. Andy laughed, shook my hand and said, "let me present our chariot for the week". After pointing out the abundance of defects, he said finally “but she runs like a dream”. I imagined an episode of the classic prehistoric based cartoon, the Flintstones. Was there a huge cut-out in the driver side stair well for Andy to manually propel the car along? Andy took photos of the lake then grabbed his snowboarding gear out the boot of the car. We headed town-wards, checked into Nomads and headed immediately back out for dinner. As we walked Andy began to chat about his journey from Christchurch. Andy, an avid photographer, captured many photos of the journey on a SLR Digital Camera. He showed me a few of his favourites; there was so much wilderness (bushland), in the central region of the South Island. I was jealous of what I saw, but; I wouldn’t have missed that view of the mountain on approach to Queenstown airport for love nor money.
!HERE!
As we stood in the hostel lobby Andy said with a beeming smile, "I'm happy with my room matey. I've got the lower bunk of the bunk-bed. I just had a quick chat with my room-mates. The girl in the top bunk is dangerously attractive. She's blonde, fit as a butcher's dog, down to earth and from the UK." He deeply exhaled through pert lips, raised both eyebrows and started to chuckle. "Right, what shall we eat?", he said. I mentioned that I'd already eaten at Ferg Burger, and recommended he take a look.

We entered Ferg Burger after a lengthy wait. Andy’s eyes went from viewing the menu to viewing the blonde-haired lady in the queue. Two beautifully crafted, floral patterened tattoos on her exposed shoulders caught Andy's attention. I could sense that Andy admired them. He said, in a loud southern English tone, “those are a lovely pair of tats”. The admired lady immediately turned around and gave me and Andy the dirtiest of looks. She grabbed her burger and stormed out of Ferg Burger. We were left bemused. I took a few moments to think about what Andy said and how it could be misinterpreted. I said to a still bemused Andy, “do you think she may have misheard the word ‘tats’?” We both laughed out loud.

Andy and I walked down the high street to an Alpine Lodge. It was long, sporting loads of indoor bar games including a section dedicated to the American style pool tables. The bar counter was also lengthy. It had a booty of winter dark ales on draught. I asked the barmaid for drink recommendations most similar to dark, flat ales. I was familiar with the breweries associated with the beer recommendations. First up was Montieth’s, I had tasted their "Black" version in Sydney. The choice on draught was impressive, and included ones I'd never heard of: Dopplebock Winter Ale, Velvet Stout and Oak-Aged Porter. I had a shot glass sample of each. These were refreshingly carbonate dark drinks, but lacked the deep, sour flavour of UK dark ales. These beers were very strong. The alcohol content was north of 5%. It was the special edition Dopplebock Winter Ale that I settled with as my drink of choice.

With drink in hand and coordination regressed, Andy and I turned to “see the action”. In a bar dominated by pool tables, the action was a no brainer, pool. The Alpine Lodge was full of people. Its floors were covered in saw dust and its bar counter covered in de-shelled peanuts. “Wait there” Andy said. He walked over and shouted to people on one of the pool tables. I could see Andy recognised them. He said, “Hey mate, how’s it going?” to two of them, shaking their hands vigorously. Andy beckoned me and made introductions. “Dave, Steve. Steve, Dave. Dave, Jon and the rest I honestly don’t know.”, Andy chuckled. “They all replied in something approaching unison, “Hello Dave!”. Andy explained that this group of snowboarding Aussies were Johnny Sayer’s mates. Being Aussies and being of the “boarding” community, they were some of the coolest people on the planet. If they were any more laid back, they’d be horizonal. From the subsequent conversation Andy had with them, a plan had been agreed. The group were “stoked” to be heading to the slopes tomorrow and asked if we could join them.

The hostel has a store room where, the following morning, I picked up my snowboarding gear. I met Andy in the lobby. He was board-less. His equipment was “secure” in the boot of the hire vehicle. As we stepped outside the hostel we were met with clear blue skies, sunlight peering over the mountains and a shimmer from the crystal-clear waters of Lake Wakapitu. I got into the car and performed a general assessment of its interior. Andy looked at me quizzically as he tried to put car key to ignition. A turned of the key put life into the struggling, cold engine. Andy's concern turned to one of delight as the engine roared. He beat his hands down on the dashboard, “Yes!” he exclaimed with enthusiasm. Andy turned his attentions to the CD/radio player. He explained that the radio was, as he put it, f*cked. However, the CD player was fully functional. The previous customer was kind enough to leave a number of compilation discs. Andy asked me to find a CD that was unscratched. Unfortunately, there weren't many that met this requirement. Not only was the radio f*cked, but most of the CDs were scratched to f\*ck too. “Bingo! We have a winner.”, I said on finding a marginally scraped disc. It inserted into the player with the smoothness of sandpaper. After a range of device related malfunctions, the music gently played. The sound was stereo, combining one working speaker on the rear passenger and driver side. I turned the volume up to eleven. Andy and I, turned, gave each looked a puzzled look and burst out laughing. Whatever this person’s tastes were, it wasn’t mainstream. We weren't sure it popular in New Zealand either. Well, unless mainstream New Zealand music was Country and Western.
!HERE!
The shitbox was taking to the wintery New Zealand hills like a duck to trees. Andy was using every bit of his adolescent driving skills to get the back end of the car to sweep round the corners. As we ascended, the car was getting precariously close to the sheer drop at the edge of the road. It was especially perilous when wider cars wanted to get by on single lane roads. The disbelief turned to tears of joy as we successfully passed a vehicle. With more ascent, there was more snow and ice on the road. It got to the point where the hire car's tyres began to lose grip. To further complicate matters, there was a big sign in the middle of the road. It indicated it was illegal to continue without tyre chains.

We were so close to the slopes. We could vaguely see the ski lifts in the distance. Andy stopped the car and indicated we should drive no further. Using gravity Andy positioned the hire car into a parking spot in the far corner of a nearby bend. Safely parked, we pulled out the snowboarding gear and disbanded. As luck had it, we saw two Korean ladies struggle to drive their car up the slope. We popped over and asked if we could assist. They pointed at a pair of tyre chains. We asked if they needed help installing them. Thankfully their English was excellent and replied with a euphoric “Yes!”. The instructions on the tyre chains indicated a full set consisted of 4, we were 2 short. Thank goodness instructions were supplied. Without them our journey to the slopes would have ended there. Instead, in a matter of minutes, Andy and I had the pair of chains installed on the back tyres. For our efforts it felt straightforward to ask for a lift. What wasn’t straightforward was how we were going to install our snowboards into their humble car with us 4 in it. It was analogous to fitting elephants into a mini. We applied an "if there's a will, there's a way" attitude to the situtation. "The way" focused on reducing the blood flow to our legs and provide extra space for the snowboards. The car pulled away slowly. The chains dug in and provided much-needed traction on the ascent. Andy and I looked at each other and laughed manically at the ridiculousness of our situtation.

I’d never seen a Kea before, the only Alpine parrot in the world. It’s a lovely looking bird, speckled green with orange notes under its wings. It was interesting observing their behaviour. In their circus (a collective name for them), the way they interacted with each other indicated a high level of intelligence. Like all intelligent animals in our world. The ones that thrive are the ones that adapt. In the case of the Kea they have adapted their diet, eating all human signage and car parts. Kea have bloody sharp beaks which will rip through anything remotely soft. It was funny to see Kea warning signs defaced by the Kea.

The slopes were busy. Andy and I easily found Johnny's mates. We just headed to the nearest drinking stop. We all looked the part for snowboarding. I was dressed looking similar South Park's Mr Hanky the Christmas Poo. The rest of the group donned a variety of brightly-coloured, eye catching outfits. The chair lifts were awkward to use, especially for me who hadn’t used one for well over a year. I somehow coordinated a successful dismount, side-stepping pain and embarrassment. That's not to say I wouldn't feel pain that day. Bring on the icy conditions.

It was a bright day and the slopes weren’t particularly steep. There were a couple of route options: route one was a standard blue grade slope, the other was terrain park focused. Andy took to the park like a Kea to road signs. I, on the other hand, was much more risk averse. When I built up enough courage to try the park I was surprised how well I navigated the obstacles. As my confidence grew I began attempting more technical maneuvers. It was evident, as the day progressed, more ice was forming on the slopes. This may be fine if the slope is straight as an arrow. Unfortunately, most slopes had turns. To take on a turn, the board needed to cut into the ice. My board was blunt, whenever I attempted to turn, I fell. Falling on virgin snow is comfortable. Falling on ice really hurts. Given the number of times I fell that day, my confidence dropped and my body was in a lot of pain. In the past I snowboarded till the slope closing time. This time round, pain dictated I should stop. For me to continue on the slopes that day I would need either pain killers or a huge cup of concrete (grit). I considered the latter. After sitting down for a short period of time my leg muscles began to seize. I fretted, there were potentially 2 days of boarding left on this holiday. I carefully considered my options. Not being one to miss an opportunity, I took a dose the pain killers and slowly got to my feet.
!HERE!
At the end of the bruising ordeal of snowboarding on the icy slopes, it was time to leave. There was oneproblem, getting back to the car that was parked a fair few miles away. Andy’s mate’s vehicle waspacked like a mini full of elephants. We would either have to walk, given my battered and bruised bodywas not an option, or hitch. The latter felt uncomfortable given I had never hitched a ride in my lifetime.I had an idea of the protocol, stick the thumb out, look friendly and lock the eyes on the drivers’. ForAndy this wasn’t new territory, the man had much more life experience than my good self. As with allactivities he took to hitching for a ride with good humour.Life Turned Upside Down83 of 156We strategically positioned ourselves on opposite sides of the icy road within clear view of each other.To use a baseball analogy, Andy was on base one, while I was home. A smart strategy, given that Andyhad a more approachable demeanour. By crikey it worked like a charm; within minutes a third car cameto a grinding halt just by Andy’s hitching spot. He indicated to me to get my arse over asap.The single 20-something-year-old Kiwi girl was a brave soul given she was about to let two 2 randomblokes into her Subaru (pronounced “soo-bah-roo”, with emphasis on the “bah”). I could sense that shewasn’t a soft soul, given her choice of vehicle and the calm way she spoke. After the multitude ofappreciative comments targeted at the driver, small talk ensued. The conversation was pleasantenough; “first time in Wanaka?”, “have you been to…?”, “they say that there’s going to be a dump ofsnow on --Day of the Week--?” It was all good, but then I took the conversation “off-piste”. It’s apersonality trait that is generally frowned upon by all listeners. Why go on a different conversation pathwhen the path currently pursued is fine? One reason I do it is because I am naturally a scatter brain. Theother reason? I love to see the reaction of the listener. The question I asked? Well, I’m going “off-piste”now come to think of it, the chats I used to have with Teresa and Andrew (a Kiwi couple I met over inOz) used to get nsfw after a big drinking session. Teresa would, without fail, ask “are you going to getyour dick wet tonight?” I never really questioned why she used to say that and was it a Kiwi thing. There,the back story. Given we were in the company of a friendly New Zealander it seemed only right to askher the question of its usage. That’s exactly what I did. Out of nowhere I blurted the question “Do youknow the phrase Getting Ya Dick Wet?” At an instance the once friendly conversational atmosphereturned to one of unease and quiet discomfort. Her head and eyes, that were once fixed on the roadahead began to magnetise towards me. My usual shy smile was replaced with one of placidness. I took agulp and looked towards her with a hangdog expression. Thoughts of “oh shit what did I just say?” filledmy once comfortable consciousness. She eventually replied with hesitation “er yeah, what about it?” Iwasn’t sure how my follow-up question was going to be structured. I hesitated, began to sweatprofusely, licked my lips and responded with a meandering “well, er, my Kiwi friends used to say it to meon nights out. I didn’t know what it meant.” She looked at me with a disgusted expression written allover her face. She replied promptly “it means to have sex.” I knew this, I wasn’t sure what shock value Iwanted from the recipient. The disgust and silence following her response, from not just her but Andytoo, was to be expected. I then questioned why I wanted it in the first instance. I could only blame it onsomething akin to tourettes syndrome. I cowered in the seat, looked out the window and estimatedhow long it might take to get to the car. The lengthy silence was broken by Andy, who I could sense wasburning holes in the back of my neck with his disgusted stare. “Do you know of any good drinking spotsaround these parts?” The Kiwi driver returned to a more comfortable state. “There aren’t that many Life Turned Upside Down84 of 156places around these parts to be honest. There’s the pub at the hostel, but the best entertainment was atthe pub a mile up the road.” Andy’s face lit up as he silently hatched a plan for the night’s proceedings.We soon arrived at Shitbox car, for me all the happier to get away from the shame I’d surroundedmyself in the Subaru. We said our deep sincere thanks to the Kiwi girl and waved as she sped off into thedistance. There was never any doubt that the rental car would still be present, not stolen that is, givenhow little in terms of monetary value the car was. In any case it was a rental car of no sentimental valueand the insurance was in Andy’s name Lake Wanaka is, in my humble opinion, one of the mostbeautiful lakes I have in memory, that and Lake St. Clair in Tasmania. The lake was flat as a pancake, onlya gentle ripple could be visible on its silky reflective surface. Unfortunately, Wanaka was quiet ingeneral, with the call of “the Ferg” we headed back to Queenstown.The next day it was time for Andy and I to part ways. Andy had a long trip back to Christchurch and I hada long walk over to the Airport. Before we said our goodbyes, Andy had something he had to get off hischest wrt his relationship with Christina (Chrissie). He said in a “warts and all” manner that he didn’tlove Chrissie and admitted to having the “wandering eye”. He continued by talking about the previousnight’s shenanigans at the hostel. “If I loved Chris I would have stopped conversation dead in the water,but I didn’t” Andy said. He continued “one of the girls in the other bunk in the shared room wasabsolutely gorgeous. You know, blonde, short and an amazing rack! We talked openly about life. Timeflew by, before we knew it we’d been talking for a good 2 hours. I said to her that I had a girlfriend, but Iknew I wanted to have sex with her. It was only that tentative loyalty to Chrissie and the feeling ofdisappointment I experienced when going through with the exercise in my head that stopped me fromproceeding. That feeling of wanting to have sex with her, it was there and it wasn’t the first time I’ve feltthis way about other women while being with Chrissie. I need to have a rethink about the relationship Ihave with Chrissie.”With that, he shook my hand as we went off on our separate ways.Life Turned Upside Down85 of 156The Broken Jaw IncidentOn return from my NZ Snowboarding excursion I was beginning to realise that a change from the normalSydney lifestyle was needed. I wanted to either move to another Sydney suburb or move to another cityentirely. After seat of the pants consideration I decided that a move to another large Australian citywould be more exciting.Knowing that the consultancy I worked through had offices down in Melbourne I had a chat with theboss, Mark, about the move. He was fine all cool with the office move, but would have preferred if Ididn’t given the raft of new business in Sydney and lack of it in Melbourne. I also mentioned the move toBecs, my flat mate who was shocked. I realised much needed to be organised before a “firm” leavingdate could be agreed, which wasn’t going to be until at least October.At the start of August, Carl, and then girlfriend Uma, was organising a get together for the Ex-PatSydney-siders. They had already booked up a 3-hour harbour cruise complete with dinner, unlimiteddrinks and cheesy entertainment for a penny-pinching $69 in September. Having never experiencedsuch a cruise and with unlimited drink being a piece of vernacular that agreed with my life style I wassoon in. I was going to give the latter part of the experience a run for its money.I turned up to Darling Harbour as the sun was setting sober as a judge. I looked out and saw a hive ofactivity as large boats began to depart, one by one with a full cargo of party goers. The boat I was Life Turned Upside Down86 of 156booked onto I hoped had inner beauty. In comparison to the rest of the fleet, it had a “boat race” only amother could love. I looked at my iphone and took a gander at the people queued up. Where were…then I saw them walking languidly in my direction. Uma forced a smile and Carl could only force a smirkygrin. Carl greeted me with a “hello dick head.” Thankfully by this stage in our friendship I wasaccommodating to his put-downs. I found his “hi c*nt” had a warmth that belied the terse language. Ididn’t feel the need to return the bitching. A smile and a hello was as good as I could muster. I askedwho else was coming along. Unfortunately, out of the Brit-pack group of nearly 20 members, only 3 ofus wanted to do this. I was beginning to wonder why?There was a flicker of activity on the “shit-box boat” as the staff began to ready the ship for onboarding.As the gangway was lowered, the plethora of couples (and me the only singleton) began to shuffle ourway to the entrance. Our tickets were checked, we were directed to our assigned tables by a chain ofstaff. My table, inside on the first floor balcony, was located right at the back. I saw Uma and Carl in thedistance, as they settled at their large table. I waved enthusiastically, Carl nodded his head, Umabeamed as they both sat down at their table.I suddenly glanced to my right as a waiter placed a bottle of red and white wine on my table. At thesame time a drinks menu was positioned in front of me. All drink items on the aforementioned menuwere included in the “all you can drink” deal. Drinks included draught, bottled beer, a range of spiritsand more wine. My heart raced with excitement, as it did when I was happy and was full of optimism ofthe night ahead.I poured myself a glass of red, necked it, a glass of white, necked it, ordered a bottle of VB, necked that. Iworked my way through the whole menu ordering a range of spirits, dark ales and more lagers. By thetime the meal had arrived, and the stage show had started I was half cooked.Life Turned Upside Down87 of 156The memory of the show was slowly dialling down as the mixture of grain and grape gripped the bloodflowing to my brain. In my semi-conscious state time was passing by at an incredible rate of knots.Before I knew it, it was time to depart. Carl and Uma walked over to my table. Uma enthusiasticallyasked me my thoughts about the show. I slurred something approaching a word in the English language,that thankfully was understood. Carl indicated that Uma and he were going to have a few drinks atJames Squire Bar before calling it a night. In my agreeable and wavering state, I said “yes” and followedthem down the platform to the harbour.As I exited the inside of the boat, the fresh air hit me like a naturally aspirated turbo charger. Taking mylevel of drunkenness to a level called “blotto”. At this level of consciousness I was finding it difficult toco-ordinate my limbs. A serious amount of focus was needed to get down the ramp and that is when Isaw the bucks party in front of the James Squire Bar.In the haze that was my recollection of events as they happened at the bar counter I noticed I wassurrounded by people dressed in funny hats and smocks. I recollected the awesome-ness that were the3-Amigos outfits that me and my friends wore on a stag in Prague. I immediately felt at ease aroundpeople with such a heroic choice in group attire. I had a quick chat with the nearest Amigo standing nextto me sighting how great they looked, purchased a round of drinks for myself, Uma and Carl. I gave theMexican’s a nod and headed over to Uma and Carl to deliver their drinks.Carl began the small talk asking how the food, drink and entertainment were on the cruise. I knew hedidn’t give 2 shits what the answer was. I looked into Uma and Carl’s eyes, they were “mildly cooked”compared to my “steaming” on the intoxication level. I enthusiastically mentioned that there were abunch of people dressed up in Mexican outfits and indicated that we should pop over and mix withthem. This suggestion didn’t go down particularly well with Umes and Carl. They said that they wereretiring early before downing their drinks and wished me all their best.Life Turned Upside Down88 of 156I walked back over to the Bucks Party group, managing to baptise myself in the Mexican theme byborrowing a sombrero. The group were leaving the James Squire Bar on route for a strip club close by toDarling Harbour.The next memory I recollect isn’t a pretty one. I look down as one of the bucks party members asks meto hold a piece of tissue to my jaw and take this taxi to the Sydney Hospital. I felt like someone hadwoken me up from a deep sleep. My brain was not fully engaged and the seriousness of the situationwas not yet realised. I pulled the tissue away from my chin and saw the blood. I reapplied it to the openwound, turned to face the taxi driver who asked if I was okay. Thankfully the alcohol has numbed mysenses enough to so that I forgot what state I was in. I replied that all was okay and asked where wewere going. He mentioned “we’re heading to Sydney Hospital, mate you’re not looking great.”As we turned the corner I could see the sleek facade of the hospital’s A&E entrance. I paid the taxi driverand headed through the first set of doors and into the waiting area. Immediately I was attended to by anurse who wanted to see my Australian ID. I handed over a card with my Medicare details, she made anote and looked my chin. “What happened to you then?” she asked. “Fell over I think” was my feebleresponse. “Take the tissue away from your chin”. As I removed the temporary bandage she took a lookand winced. “You’ll be needing stitches for that!” she exclaimed. “Come on though to the ward, we’ll getyou a bed.” Off she sped returning with a large plaster that she stuck to my chin. ”There, that should bebetter, let me grab you a patient robe.” The distinctive blue uniform was presented to me, looking adamn sight cleaner than my blood and alcohol-soaked clothes. The nurse pulled the blinds around mybed, asked me to remove my clothing, put the night dress on and hop into the hospital bed.As I stared at the ceiling I took a moment to absorb the situation. I was in a hospital bed with a gash onmy chin. As I moved my jaw something didn’t feel right. It was apparent that my top and bottom teethno longer met as I forced a bite. I had to instead apply additional force the right side of my bottom jawto ensure the teeth met. It felt unnatural to keep the teeth together. After releasing that additionalpressure, only the teeth on the left side of my mouth were together. I used my tongue to assess thecondition of my teeth. It was like probing an alien entity. The jagged feel and looseness of some teethshook me to my core. What the hell happened to me!? I was temporarily distracted, the nurse soonappeared and asked me to sit up. She gently removed the band aid attached to my chin, cleaned thecongealed area and injected it with a quick acting local anaesthetic. She laced a plastic thread through a Life Turned Upside Down89 of 156large needle and immediately began stitching the chin wound. Her quick and precise movement to thejob at hand indicated a high level of proficiency. After a large bandage was applied over the stitching sheasked me to lie back in the hospital bed.It went deathly quiet for what seemed like an eternity. My thoughts were “was I going to be left in thisstate? When can I get out of here? I’m fine, am I not?” The curtains surrounding my bed were flung backand as quickly closed. Another medical staff member was present, but this time it was a young Aussiefellow with strawberry-blonde flowing hair. He asked me to show my forearm and warned me that whathe was going to do next might be uncomfortable. Inserting a big needled IV drip into the arm could beseen by many as discomforting. Thanks to the number of injections I received as a child at the dentist (alot of work was done on the teeth as a child) I had no trouble receiving the IV. The medical staff memberapplied a bandage around the insertion point and hooked me up to a mobile saline solution. After theprocedure was completed I relaxed and brought awareness to my body. The medical staff memberasked if I felt any discomfort, other than the obvious IV puncture wound. My physical assessment mademe realise the alcohol was slowly wearing off and pain from the leg and jaw was starting to amplify. Ianswered with a defiant “yeah!” “Okay, I’ll apply a dose of morphine via the drip” the staff membersaid. Out the corner of my eye I could see another solution being attached to the drip, a squeeze of thesyringe and… I felt euphoria on a level that I had never experienced in my life. All pain instantlyevaporated and the endorphin rush was clearly evident. “Wow! Jeez” I remember thinking. The amazingrush took a short time to end, leaving me breathless. My eyes soon began to close and… 321, after onlya few hours deep sleep, I woke up. The morphine had worn off and the pain was back. Not only was thepain back, but somehow I’d inherited a new neighbour. There was a lot of commotion “next door”.You often need something to compare against to put clarity on the extent of your current state. This wasone of those somethings; next door a young party goer was in a bad state. It was a battle of the body vsthe drugs. From the conversation I overheard, she had inadvertently overdosed. The family was presentoffering their support, but initially it wasn’t looking good for said party goer.When I wake, for whatever reason nature calls and this was no exception. The commotion from nextdoor had provided a temporary distraction, but with the pain of the body the bladder thought itappropriate to trump the discomfort of everything else. I swung my legs to the side of the bed, grabbedmy mobile IV unit and hobbled toilet wards wherever that was to be.Life Turned Upside Down90 of 156After successfully locating the bathroom, a stones throw from bed side, I began emptying the bladder inthe urinal provided. What was great was seeing the heaps of mirrors that filled the walled panorama. Ilooked at the mirror in front of me, and like an inquisitive child, I stared at myself. It was more of anassessment than a shallow admiration. What had changed? Okay, I’ve got a chuffing great plasterapplied to my bloody chin, my glasses look slightly knackered, but that didn’t bother me. What botheredme was the alignment of my jaw. It was “skew if” to describe it tersely. The right-hand side of my lowerjaw had dropped. My teeth appeared to look okay, my jaw needed to be fixed.It was difficult to open my jaw, a lot of effort was required to close it. That was before trying to correct“the slant”. To correct the droop I had to focus all my efforts into the mouth close coordination process.After a few deep breaths I managed it. My jaw was closed and molars on both sides, top and bottommanaged to touch. A few additional deep breaths through the nose were required to keep the jaw in theclosed state. As the sweat began to form at the brow, I released, again breathing heavily. I felt pleasedwith the results of my initial assessment, but I wasn’t 100% sure.A made my way back to bed and lay there awake trying best to shut my eyes. I was tired, but the noisefrom next door and the pain from my body was keeping me from nodding off. The commotion from nextdoor died down after the overdose patient woke up from her drug induced slumber. Only the pain wasnow keeping me awake. Thankfully the tiredness became overwhelming and I passed out.The hospital became enshrined in light first thing as the sun began to rise over Sydney Harbour. Thisangelic call made me stir and wince as I tried to open my eyes. The pain immediately came to myattention along with my state of being. I didn’t want to be in hospital any more. For a start I was boredand secondly, I didn’t want Becks to be worried. I had to get back home. With that, a staff memberappeared and asked me how I was doing. Given my desperation for a reprieve I enthusiasticallyindicated that my physical and mental fitness was superb, never better. The staff member began askingmore personal questions about me which were then written to a form. He handed me and said “Right, Life Turned Upside Down91 of 156sign here and you’re good to go!” I was in a state of disbelief, “I can go?” I thought, “I best keep thatnon-self-assured thought to myself…”Moments later the staff member returned with my worldly possessions which had a few marks, bloodand scrape, added to them like tattoos. I happily changed into my re-united gear, dusted them off andtried to walk normally and confidently to the reception area. I could hear the clop, clop, clop of my hardsoled shoes as they tapped the clean hard floor surface. At reception I handed my discharge form to thereceptionist and thanked the hospital dearly for the care that they had provided. I squinted as the earlymorning sun hit my eyes on approaching the large glass exit.Once outside the fresh morning air hit, thankfully the alcohol levels in my blood stream had subsidedsomewhat. Instead of accelerating my level of drunkenness it acting towards reversing it. The downsideof being in a “blotto” state is the come-down, the sobering period. There was undoubtedly going to be ahangover, which is a symptom of excessive alcohol consumption. It mattered not what I was going to doto alleviate it so I had to carry the burden with me on the empty Sunday morning streets of Sydney. Ihobbled and cowered as I walked, reacting to both the pain of shame and my leg injury. As I sobered Itried to recollect what happened the night before. There was just too much I did not know. My brain’ssynapses managed to record a vague entry before and after the almighty fall. No memory bank wasavailable in my head to give the faintest idea of what happened. I t was at that moment that I had an“ah ha” moment. I rummaged through my pockets like a ferret capturing the scent of a cornered rabbit.I stopped in my walking tracks and emptied the stash from the front trouser pockets. Nothing. Coatpockets? Nothing. Back jean pockets? “What do we have here?” I thought. Something the size of abusiness card was extracted. I took a glancing look at it. What the hell? The name of the city’s popularstrip club was embossed in gold across it sleek and inappropriately rude lines. “What the b’Jesus was Idoing in a strip club? And why couldn’t I remember anything from, what quite probably have been, sucha great experience?” It was just another vestige of a night out that could have been innocuous butended up being a world of pain.I continued dragging my carcass to the Rose Bay flat. Time in this sobering state seemed to accelerate.Before I knew it I was home. I walked into the common area and collapsed onto the sofa. I staredvacantly at the white ceiling and realised I was the only person in the flat. Where was Bec’s? I was quitehappy that she wasn’t around. I’m sure her first question would have been “where were you last night?” Life Turned Upside Down92 of 156followed up with “you dirty stop out.” I was a definitely a dirty stop out, but not for the innuendo thephrase applied to.Everything in my hungover state was an effort. I hated myself for being this way. I was 31, I had 13 yearsof drinking week-in, week-out under the belt that underpinned my gut. I should know better, why hadn’tI learnt from my mistakes. This though was the most impactful injury I had sustained during any onesingle night out. This injury was beginning to make me think about drinking in an unhealthy way.Something I had not done before or since.My curiosity got the better of me, I wanted to see the state of my face. I got onto my feet and looked inthe nearby mirror. It was the chin that took my attention. The congealed mess that was my chin was amixture of stale blood stitching and red volcanic ooze that was currently being held in place. I moved mylower jaw in a clockwise motion and assessed its state. It ached, my teeth still didn’t feel part of mymouth; at least my French handmade glasses were looking sharp as ever. I thought it appropriate to findmy camera to take snaps of my head from various angles to ensure nothing else was amiss on the“business end” of the body. Thankfully, after examination of the photo set, the damage was localised tothe areas of the face that I had already highlighted.It wasn’t going to be the end to pain, the journey of xrays, extraction and implanting was just around thecorner. The jaw ache was the first area that needed attention. To assess that a visit to the public hospitalwas required. A phone call, a bus journey and an X-Ray later it was revealed that my lower jaw hadnearly broken all the way through at the chin. My chin, being a battler was at that point held in place bya hair’s breadth of bone. The doctor was astonished this was the case, luck was definitely on my side.My teeth that was a different issue. The doctor was no dental specialist and recommended for me to seea dentist as soon as. After relaying the news of my incident to my flatmate Bec’s, who was voiced her Life Turned Upside Down93 of 156care and concern for me, she recommended I visit her private dentist located a couple of blocks fromthe flat.On entering the dentist’s reception my attentions were focused on the welcoming receptionist, wife andaide to the dentist Mr Weinstien. I relayed to her my imminent appointment time, which she dulyconfirmed on the computer. She then asked a question that I had not needed to answer before. “Do youhave health insurance?” I knew that the purchase of health insurance was a no brainer. If you didn’thave it you would have to pay a tax premium at the end of the tax year. Stupidly and unscrupulously Ihadn’t invested in, which would now be appropriate, said health insurance. The receptionist wassomewhat surprised by my answer (the majority of Aussie’s had it); she proceeded with warning thatany follow-up appointments were going to be expensive without insurance. “Please take a seat, thedentist will be with you shortly.”Dental Surgeon Weinstien appeared in the waiting room with a smile on his face and a twinkle in hiseye. Unusual, you could say, it was midday and he had seen many patients by that time. I looked over“David?” he asked with an air of confidence. I smiled, got to my feet and reached out my hand to shakehis. He did so with enthusiasm, his eyes gleaming, his hand shake firm. The 50-something dental surgeonappeared to be a bill of health and looked every bit the professional that was advertised on the plaquethat donned the entrance to his surgery. “Come this way and take a seat in the dental chair”. I did sowith a feeling of ease and comfort. He stood next to me tapping away on the keyboard of his computer,finishing entering details of a previous patient and readying the computer database for new patientdetails. He proceeded to extract the mandatory pieces of information from my memory e.g., name, dob,address, and eventually asked the question I was wanted to answer. “So how can I help you Mr Clarke?”I grimaced and said “I recently fell over and hurt my jaw. The hospital recommended I see a doctor andmy flat mate recommended your good self.” “Ah, okay, well let’s have a quick look, shall we?” “Openyour mouth as wide as you can” he commanded. I tried effortfully, but the lower jaw was not budgingmuch, an inch of gap between the top and bottom sets of teeth was revealed. “Is that the widest youcan open your mouth?” he concernedly asked. I nodded. “Ok, let’s see,” He began to prod my teethgently with his index finger. I could clearly feel the movement of some of the teeth and felt theassociated pain. I breathed in quickly, emitting a whisping sound. “Fuck!” Surgeon Weinstien added. Herecoiled and retracted his prodding finger from my teeth. I felt edgy & concerned. I had never heard adentist use profanity before. “Ok David, I’ll be truthful. It doesn’t look good in there. What happened?!”I began recounting the story of the night out to the depths that my conscious memory allowed. “Ok, weneed to take a few X-Rays to get a better analysis of the total impact to your jaw.” He added.Life Turned Upside Down94 of 156I proceeded to the X-Ray booth and stood there to allow multiple shots to be taken. A few momentslater they were ready and again we entered the surgery room to take a look at the X-Rays, illuminatedby the bright neon light panel. “As I suspected, given my initial analysis.” He continued “there is majortrauma here, here, here and here.” “Luckily, your front teeth and rear molars, which have sustainedmost of the impact, appear to be fine. What is very concerning is the state of your jaw. I don’tunderstand. Given the details from the X-Ray there appears to be a fracture that runs through thecentre of your jaw that cuts right through it. I don’t understand how your jaw is still in one piece! Theanalysis of the jaw is beyond my current level of expertise. You will need to go and see the hospitalbefore we can continue any further work on it. Apart from the obvious broken tooth, there are a fewcracks and chips here and there.”With that, the surgeon escorted me back to the waiting area where he re-introduced me to thereceptionist. “Ok Mr Clarke”, she began tapping away on the keyboard and pulled a piece of A4 paperfrom the printer. She pulled no punches “how would you like to pay the bill?” I pulled the A4 papertowards me and peered at the itinerary for the 10 minutes of work that was completed. My jaw, thatfailed to open wide earlier, nearly dropped as my eyes ran to the bottom of the piece of paper. Iuncomfortably smiled and shifted my weight to one side to get a different angle of the price. It made nodifference, $100 of anyone’s money was going to cause discomfort. On the back foot I asked “er, do I getany discount based on Medicare?” The receptionist lightly smiled and said “unfortunately, we do not,we only accept private medical insurance cards that includes the pre-requisite dental cover…” Ihesitantly pulled my wallet and slowly searched for my Commonwealth Bank Visa card. I inserted it intothe card reader, entered my PIN and pulled my lips tort. A receipt was printed off amongst theelectronics in the reception booth. The receptionist tore off said receipt and handed a copy to me. Iscrambled to place the receipt in my wallet, said my goodbyes and rushed for the exit.A visit to the Australian equivalent of the NHS practice revealed good news. The multiple X-Rays thatthey took did indeed reveal what the dental surgeon had feared. There was indeed a jaw fracture, but ithad not persisted all the way through. In other words, my jaw was being held together by a thread ofjaw bone. The public hospital doctor told me that I was very lucky and should rest the jaw for a couple ofweeks before considering any further dental treatment. With that I happily booked a follow-up dentalappointment with Dr Weinstien that would be the beginning of the end of the discomfort.Life Turned Upside Down95 of 156The dental consultation day had finally arrived, and I was ready to take onboard the “plan of action”. AsI sat in the dentist chair and waited for Dr Weinstein I experienced a level of gratification. A plan,however long winded it might, when actioned, was going to result in a discomfort free me. “Right” DrWeinstien sighed heavily as he raised the X-Rays in front of me. He pointed out 4 teeth: 3 molars, 1canine; the 3 here, here and here will need to be drilled out and this broken canine… I discussed thiswith a fellow dentist, it will need to pulled out using a special tool. All in you are looking at 2 visits. Ifyou’d like we can take care of the molars now and the next session we can take care of that canine.You don’t have health insurance?” I shook my head, he continued “these procedures are not going to becheap, we’ll try to keep the cost to a minimum, but you will be looking at a cost of over $1000. It couldbe more if there are complications during the extraction process.”On the morning of what I thought was going to be a normal dental check-up ended in 2 back teeth beingremoved! 2 of the blighters, right side upper and lower were cracked all the way through! All in I was atthe dentists for an hour and half while Doctor “Yankem” Weinstien drilled and yanking every bit of the 2teeth in question. Thankfully, the anaesthetic was shielding me from a lot of pain! After both teeth werecompletely removed the doctor sewed a synthetic material into the gum to help the jaw bone heal. I hadseveral gausses placed in between the 2 bloody gaps and was asked to take a medicine cabinet's worthof pain killers. As I exited the dentist, $960 down and high as a kite I got home, got changed into myformal clothes and headed to work. The anaesthetic at that point was starting to wear off. By 4pm thenerve endings in my mouth woke up. At that point work was playing a secondary role. I just hadNeurofen on my mind.The pain in my gums was a tiring one. The pain would wake me up during the first few nights after thesurgery. Thankfully Neurofen would be my saving grace during the second procedure too. During which Ihad a $160 filling and the most intricate extraction of a canine that I had experienced before or since. I’dnever seen a dentist so happy as Doctor Weinstien that day. In the surgery room he held a toothextraction tool aloft; he delighted in saying that he had borrowed it from his colleague after a dentist’smothers type meeting in a pub. The tools only purpose was for canine extraction. The device was akin to Life Turned Upside Down96 of 156a cork screw for the tooth, but instead of screw, there was a lasso that gripped around the base of thesliced tooth. Pulling force was applied gradually, and as described by the dentist it was akin tounfastening Velcro. Of course, I was “numbed” for this procedure; the yank continued and then my jawgently recoiled. The tooth was free from its “Velcro-like” bindings and completely removed. No furtherwork would be required on the jaw to ensure that the rest of the tooth base had been extracted. It wasthere, complete and “beautiful”, to the delight of Doctor Wienstein. His smile said it all; “excellent” heremarked. “Wait till I tell my colleague when we next meet down the pub, he’ll be very happy his toolwas put to good use.”Doctor Weinstien proceeded with details of the next steps. “Now, you will need to consider if you wantprosthetics. There are options in this area:Option 1: Have nothing done.Option 2: You can have false teeth with a metal brace, which when attached to the other teeth to woulddo a great job fill the gaps.Option 3: This is the most expensive option, but one which I would recommend the most out of the 3.Permanent prosthetics. This would involve inserting a plug into the jaw and screwing the prosthetic intoit.If you do consider having prosthetics you will have to wait at least 4 months. The jaw bone needs to fullyheal before any false teeth can be attached. If you do opt for the permanent prosthetics option, please Life Turned Upside Down97 of 156be aware that you could pay as much as $4500 per tooth!” After hearing news of the substantial cost Itook a mental snapshot of my current bank balance and sighed. Oh well, I thought, it was going to be 4months before I would need to consider any further dental work. I could look at my options then, ormaybe I can live without? It was too early to tell. In the meantime, I was really looking forward tochewing food with the back teeth at some point in the near future. I had taken that pleasure for grantedfar too often in the past.I hadn’t been living in Rose Bay for that long, but during that short time I yearned to travel more. I was,after all, planning to be in Australia for only 6 weeks to “give it a go”. It had been nearly a year since Ifirst set foot onto the golden shores of this beautiful country. The problem and an advantage ofAustralia is its remoteness. I had “only” been to Queensland, New South Wales and the South Island ofNew Zealand. These weren’t European short haul style flights either, these were long-haul.Being a gluten for adventure I wanted to experience more and, as with Sydney, the idea of travelling andworking was a cool way to see more. The software testing consultancy was going to be a great vessel toget what I wanted. KJRA had offices in Queensland and Victoria. Having more of a think of where,Melbourne Victoria was the more favourable option given its standing. It was considered globally as oneof the best cities to live in. Now, the difficult part, I had to ask the question to my boss, Mark. Thiswasn’t going to be as straightforward as I had envisaged.One day in October I sent an email to Mark with my desire to work at their Melbourne office. Mark wasfast to respond, within minutes of hitting the send button the phone rang. I was caught off guard by theimmediacy, something was up. “Dave?” he said quizzically. “Hi Mark, did you get my email?” I replied.“Yep, that’s what I want to talk to you about. I’m happy for you join the team down in Melbourne. Youmust be aware that they currently have a large bench. Business is picking up in Melbourne, but it isrunning slowly, as is does at this time of year.” He explained. “That’s fine Mark, when would be anappropriate time to make the move?” I asked. “One thing I can say is it’s not going to be immediate, letme look into the situation and once I know I will give an indication of that time window.” Mark said.Excellent, an immediate surge of adrenaline kicked into the system as I felt excitement and trepidation.Selfishly I had only considered my needs, forgetting about the people who now formed my network, myfriends, my adopted families. I had to tell them of my plans, this would dwarf the uncomfortable feelingsI had felt while communicating with Mark.Life Turned Upside Down98 of 156The short 6-week performance testing engagement at Macquarie Bank was a short one, stressful andthoroughly satisfying. A highlight of my career. Having to handle the pressures of work and thepressures of friendships was difficult. The friends that I cared for the most were: Bruce Rawsthorne (Oz),Andy (UK), Andi (NZ), Becky (UK), Carl (UK) and Johnny (UK). It was going to be difficult to inform themall in one place, so it was a matter of seeing them one-by-one, respectfully, face-to-face.I began closest to home, Becky, my flatmate. I explained in the only way I knew, bluntly. I relayed theidea of “experiencing more of Australia.” She didn’t understand. She explained that I had a closenetwork of friends here in Sydney. They cared for me and I was enjoying life, why move? There is a sideto me which is stubborn, one which was inherent in my late mother. When I had my mind set on anidea, I had to follow it through to the end. I could sense her disappointment, and like a brother, I caredabout how she felt.Out of the remaining close friends, Carl and Johnny were the people hit hardest by the news. Carl, in anunexpected turn, took the news with anger, a reaction I hadn’t experienced before after relaying newsthat didn’t directly impact them. I was taken aback, but reasoned it was fine to have such feelings. It hadtaken a long time to build up the relationship that we had, for him especially, who had invested so muchtime seeing me walk away. Johnny, a more distant mate had very similar feelings to Becky. My otherfriends were more forgiving, they, had similar feelings to me about their futures.I had no idea how much people cared for me. I hadn’t taken the time to consider people’s feelings whenmaking decisions in the past. Not only was I stubborn, but selfish too. I reflected on my friends andfamily back at home and how the impact of me moving to Australia must have had on their lives. Tothink, of all the people I knew and cared for, it was my mom who had the most interest in my life. Of allthe people, it was mom who would keep me up to date with news back at home. It was mom whowould Skype me every week. It was mom, I realised, who loved and supported me the most.Life Turned Upside Down99 of 156With the pending move to Melbourne pencilled in to Mark, my boss’s, todo list as of Monday 1stNovember I felt it appropriate to inform “the crew”. With email being the communication method ofchoice at the time for such an occasion I crafted the following:“As many of you are aware I've chosen to move to Melbourne. I've set the date for the big move, it isSunday 31stOctober.I would be great if you could join me in celebrating the "Passing of the Dave".Saturday 30th October, THE LONDON bar at 7:00pm“Life Turned Upside Down100 of 156With the email sent, it was now a matter of getting myself organised for the move, which meant usingthe internet tool of choice, Google. I had a lot of items in the Rose Bay flat that I’d purchased and didn’tnecessarily want to part with including:One king size bed with super comfy mattress and memory foam cushions.Side table.PS342” LG TVLife Turned Upside Down101 of 156I wondered how much it would cost to transport all items, which had a retail value in excess ofAU$1000, down to Melbourne? Could I hire a van and drive the items down there, leaving the hirevehicle down there too? A few finger taps later and I found an answer, north of AU$500. Add the hassleof loading and offloading the items into and off the van. Take into account the 900km, 600 miles,multiday drive. Was it going to be worth it just to get my items down there? What about hiring aremoval company to do the work for me? Well, again the price was going to be north of AU$500.Bugger.It was all well and good having the cart before the horse i.e., the means of moving my items to a newplace before finding a new home, but I did need that in place before hand. How was I going to find andsecure new accommodation rental? Finding wasn’t going to be a problem, the internet opened up theworld of rental possibilities, which given my budget and time window, was very limited. 5 propertieswere available to move into in November. I contacted each to find out availability, of the 5 only 2 werestill available. The first was based in the suburb of Hawthorne and the other was located in a suburbfurther out east. The Hawthorne apartment seemed the most promising from the pictures anddescription but looks can be deceiving as I found out with the Manly flat. It was obvious the secondproperty was advertised by an estate agent, given the cagey responses that I received. Anyway, I needed“the other property” as a means of leverage. With that, in the second weekend of October I organised afly in-viewing for both properties. Great, hopefully I’d be able to see some of Melbourne City itself, butthat was looking very unlikely given the tight schedule.Having organised my day trip and return flights, I was set. I flew out of Sydney International Airport totouch down at Melbourne Tullamarine. I was lucky, the destination airport was the easiest of theMelbourne Airports to travel to Melbourne City from. What was frightening was the distance the“Skybus” had to travel to get to the city. Anyway, the Skybus offered a sublime level of comfort andentertainment to keep me occupied before the cityscape of Melbourne revealed itself.Melbourne is arguably not as beautiful as its rival city Sydney and historically there has been muchdiscussions around which should be the capital. It was decided that a separate capital be formed,equidistance between the two and home to Australia’s parliament, Canberra.Life Turned Upside Down102 of 156On reaching Melbourne City I sprung into action. Right, first stop was going to be Hawthorne where Iwould meet Luncinda, an Aussie female in her late 20s of Scottish descent. One aspect I did find bizzarewith regards to Melbourne was its lack of an underground railway system. It was all over ground and notparticularly regular at that. Thankfully Hawthorne station was less than 100 metres away from theproperty. Using the magic of Apple Maps on the iPhone 3GS I was in good hands to find the property’slocation.It was easy enough to find the property, but which door was THE front door. There were at least 3 thatmet the requirements; I chose to pick up the phone and call Lucinda to confirm. “Hello, is that Lucinda?”I asked timidly. A piercing, anglicised voice replied “Yes, it is, is that David?”. I confirmed her question,“where are you?”. Indicating I was outside she hurridley said “It’s not easy to find this property, I’ll comedownstairs and let you in.”Lucinda was a little out of breath as she opened the front door. She smiled nervously, the piercing toneof her voice was clearer as she introduced herself. “Hi, my name is Lucinda, pleased to meet you.” Herintroduction was followed up with a giggle, indicating her elation given I’d turned up. She knew I’d comeall the way from Sydney to Melbourne for the soul purpose of accommodating myself.I was taken aback by how attractive she was and instantly questioned why a person this attractive wasfinding it difficult to attract a tenant. She had an arrangement with the landlord very similar to thatwhich “Manly” Flo had. I was nervous about the whole sub-tenant shenanigans given I never did get mydeposit back from the Feisty French lady. Life Turned Upside Down103 of 156As we climbed the single flight of stairs we were faced with yet another door; this one being theentrance to her flat. She opened the door and showed me around. “This is the bathroom… the lounge…the kitchen… the balcony… the bedroom available for rent.” The flat was all open plan, modern andcomfortable. The kitchen, dining room, and living room melded into one. I was impressed with the useof space, being a fan of a minimalist interior. Lucinda giggled as she indicated her room Lucinda giggledas she indicated her room, she gave the door knob a exaggerated pull to ensure the contents of theroom was out of sight of my prying eyes. I was sold, it felt homely; it wasn’t as prestigious as the flat inRose Bay. It would be difficult to find somewhere that offered an Australian iconic view, Sydney HarbourBridge in this case. At least it was close to a train station, the Rose Bay flat was far from that, but didhave good transport links to Circular Quay via the fast ferry. Anyway, for my first Melbourne viewing myspirits were lifted.As with anything that has pros, it’s difficult not to question the cons. What was wrong with the situationhere. I asked the question to Lucinda “why is the property available?” She was forthcoming with heranswer, indicating her frustrations. The story was her previous sub-tenant was difficult from day one:not paying bills in a timely manner, not being tidy and leaving owing rent. She indicated that she was stillchasing the rent owed. She indicated the room was available immediately given the previous tenant hadupped and foxtrot Oscar-ed.I was sold by her heart-felt reasoning and with that I shook her hand, smiled and made my way throughthe exit on the ground floor. I had a little time to burn before the next organised viewing. With it beingclose to lunch time I thought it appropriate to head citywards. I got out the swiss army knife of the 21stCentury, the iPhone, and plugged in my citywards destination. The Maps app sprung into life andsuggested I take the train at Hawthorn Station. It was at this moment that I noticed that the phone’scurrent battery life wasn’t all too rosy.The journey into the city was a mixture of peering down at the maps screen, the battery symbol andbriefly out the window to get my bearings. The sun bathed the landscape and made something lackingenergy, like walking, a sweaty affair especially with a back pack slung over the shoulders.Life Turned Upside Down104 of 156I walked from the iconic Melbourne Flinders Station up the road on the look out for a lunch spot. What Idid notice was the sheer number of “pubs”; I use pub in the loosest possible way given how differentthey are to their British brethren. What I did notice was a common deal amongst these publicestablishments: A pint and a parmigiana for AU$10. As I passed what felt like the 10th pub I gave in andentered. The pub of submission was more like a English pub than any I’d visited before or since. Dark,bar stooled, stale beer on horridly designed carpets and a letter box style bar front. I felt at homeimmediately.I ordered the obligatory parmigiana and a pint and set my eyes on my now dead iPhone. I asked thequestion, which I was expecting the worst answer for “do you have an iPhone charger.” A resoundingYES was the surprise answer I received; I nearly weaped and kissed the barmaid. I composed myself andhanded over the dead phone. With that I walked over to a table nearby, with my mind set on doingsome work on my laptop with an eyeful guard on my phone.Work of late had begun to spill into the chaos which was my personal life. It stressed me out thinkingabout it and filled my adrenal gland with a heavy dose to course through my veins. I connected to thepub wifi, the work VPN and fired up the email application. There was a long pause after the emaildownload icon flashed up, then there it was, an email from the client asking questions about the resultsI had provided during the last Daily Performance Test Analysis session. I baulked, I fired up thespreadsheet that accompanied her concerns. I looked a little deeper into the numbers, calmed mythoughts and began to answer each of her queries in the best way business knows best, bullet-pointedin green font.After 10 minutes of typing I clicked the send button and felt a huge sense of relief. I was somewhatproud of myself, because:Life Turned Upside Down105 of 156I looked pro-active and keen, having answered her query on the weekend.I had one less activity to concern myself with on the Monday.“Win, win” as they say.My gaze was temporarily diverted from the glow of the computer screen to the dish that arrived and setnext to my computer on the crowded pub table. I closed the laptop lid and carefully placed the clientlaptop in my rucksack. I slid the plate of Chicken Parmigiana into view and assessed the contents of theplate. There was a thin piece of breaded chicken, a tomato-based sauce and a portion of oven-ready,cooked from frozen chips. I heard so much about the Chicken Parmigiana, this would be the first timefor me to try the iconic dish. A dish the people of Melbourne claimed as their own, with its originsrooted in Italy, a region well represented here by its inhabitants. Being hungry, I smashed it, as its levelof preparation intended.I checked the time on the wall-side clock, balked and downed the pint of Victoria Bitter. I headed over tothe bar to ask for my phone to be returned. I pressed the home button and immediately felt reliefseeing the battery life peer above the 50% mark. I swung my bag over my shoulders and soldiered onoutside to the high street. I reached for my phone and fired up Google Maps to direct me to the nextviewing location. By Google’s estimation, which was usually on the pessimistic side, I would reach theviewing 5 minutes after that scheduled time. No dramas, 5 kilometres and 1 hour to go.Life Turned Upside Down106 of 156A message pinged its way to my phone as I trundled. I looked, it was “the bloke” or to be more accuratethe Estate Agent. I read the message once then a second time to contemplate the full extent of theintent. It read “I’m really sorry mate, I’m not going to be able to make the viewing we have scheduledthis afternoon. Really, really sorry.” Incredulous, I began to fume. I was aware that I had left little timefrom the end of the arranged viewing to the flight departure. There was no way to reschedule. I didsomething I only do if I have no other options, beg. My pleaded text read “As you are aware I’m headingback to Sydney this evening. I have no time today to reschedule, is there no way to make the arrangedviewing? I have no other options.” The reply was jokey in tone and reflected how much the estate agentcared “The next time I see you I’ll buy you a crate of beer.” The text was made the more poignant as Iwalked past a Bottle-O. I thought “If this guy put his money where his mouth is I’d purchase thecontents of the shop and foot him the bill.”To quote the British Sci-Fi Comedy Red Dwarf, when it came to accommodation choices, I had “lesschoice than a Welsh Fish and Chip shop”. With shoulders drooped and mind focussed on the one flat Ihad seen during my small value-added trip. I did what most people with very little choice would do, Ipictured myself experiencing that choice. Did I enjoy what I was experiencing? …Er, yes, but. Thehesitation was brought on by my lack of housing examples in Melbourne. Sure, the flat that LucindaGraham had offered was nice compared some of the Sydney-side accommodation that I had seen, buthow did it compare to the other Melbourne properties? The answer to that question made me nervous.Hah well, one thing I did have plenty of was time. I would be able to get over to Melbourne Airport inplenty of time. “No dramas, no worries, too easy” to quote my colleague Elliot Caldwell. With that Ijourneyed home back to Melbourne via a combination of public transport options: Train, Skybus andAirplane.On the week after my return to Sydney, Mark, my boss, called with a proposition of a great job rolecoming up with accommodation paid for in Sydney. After careful consideration I decided the offer wastoo good to refuse. I now, unfortunately, had to play “boy who cried wolf” and contact my local Sydneyside mates. The leaving do wasn’t going to be a leaving do anymore, just a night out. I looked at thepositives, I would be seeing more of these lovely, trustworthy people a little more.In the coming days I would once again speak to my boss about the Sydney-side plans. It seemed therewas a lot up in the air: Where would I be staying? Where would my worldly possessions be stored?Life Turned Upside Down107 of 156I was due to move out of the Rose Bay flat on Saturday October 23rd. Further conversations with Markmade for a more definitive exit plan.Work - I would finish up on the Macquarie Bank project on the Friday.Accommodation - Saturday, move into a hotel in Potts Point for a week then onto a guest house inGlebe the following week.Storage – Organised, the removal people were scheduled between 9 and 10am. The bed needed to bedismantled in preparationThe accommodation in Potts Point was, as for all small business-related choices, cheap. It was a flat atleast, plenty of room, personal and a place I could call home for the short term.Life Turned Upside Down108 of 156Knowing that housing me while I was “in transition” from pillar, Sydney, to post, Melbourne, was of littleinterest to the people of HR I thought I would perform my own accommodation search. I had a look atapartments in Sydney and found something that was of equal cost to that in Potts Point, heaps plusherand more affordable. The flat was located over in Crows Nest, a suburb in Sydney, north of NorthSydney.Having moved of what remained of my worldly goods over to it I was set. The itinerary for the remainingweeks before my move to Melbourne were going to be shaky at best. What was for sure, having nowdeveloped a relationship with the ex-pat community and colleagues there were plenty of nights outorganised.Each week I was in touch with Carl, Johnny and Andy to organise drinks over in the suburb ofPaddington, Coogee and the CBD. I still hadn’t learnt from the fractured jaw incident. As the wounds inthe mouth healed I was happily getting blotto. This was easily done with my colleague Teresa andpartner Andy. Those two didn’t have an off switch, once work had finished and we were in a pub,drinking became a session that included extra time.One particular night found me, Teresa, Andy, Elliot and Bruce at a drinking venue around the cornerfrom the office. It started a chin-wag, auxillary drinkers Bruce and Elliot made their excuses and made abeeline for their respective homes stating that their other halves were quizzing them of theirwhereabouts.It left me with the New Zealand duo of Andy and Teresa. Teresa’s sons were over living with the couple.The eldest, --insert name here--, was only 16 years her junior. New to Sydney, looking for buildingcontract work, he was available to meet up with us in the Rocks to extend the group of 3 to a group of 4.Life Turned Upside Down109 of 156We continued on to “The Rocks” area of Sydney. The oldest, most tourist and most expensive retail areain Sydney. The main road lead up to a number of excellent drinking establishments. Teresa, Andy,--insert name here-- and I were already well on the way to an inebriated state. Our next stop would be ata venue that wasn’t much appreciated by me, but my cosmopolitan colleagues had to try. The WineCentre was a small retail establishment, pay your money, collect your tokens and exchange tokens forsamples of wine. I was somewhat swayed by red wine, for some reason I found the taste to be biggerand easier to distinguish than its white sibling. Each wine, plastered to the wall of the Wine Centre hadits associated tasting notes, there was also a member of staff on hand to guide us through the drinkingprocess. The process included: smelling, swirling and down-ning. The latter I excelled at; Andy andTeresa were in their element. From hearing their line of questioning directed to the on-hand expert theywere quite particular with what they wanted to sample. As a novice I went with the flow. Having only 3drink sampling tokens to Andy and Teresa’s 5, I was happy to try whichever red wines they thought wereappropriate. I gave the default response when asked what I thought of the samples, “nice”. The “nice”response was my go-to answer for anything I either didn’t understand or thought was terrible. In thiscase it was the former that applied. Andy and Teresa were impressed with a couple of the white wines,enough so that they purchased a couple of bottles before we made our way back onto the darkenedstreets of the Rocks. A look around and phone call later, Teresa took charge of our drinking logistics.“Right, to the Bier Keller!” Teresa proclaimed, straining her wine saturated vocals.On exiting the Wine Centre the fresh air wafted into the alcohol saturated bloodstream. The world feltslightly tilted, balance was becoming less automatic and more a taxing effort. I began to sway on thecobbled surface of The Rocks streets as we approached the unassuming front door of the Bier Keller. Aswe entered the space below the low ceiling of the old colonial building revealed itself. It took a lot offocus to navigate past the mass of tables and around the undulating floor surface. Out the corner of myeye I saw Teresa’s Son --insert name here-- with what I presumed was Teresa’s old work colleague.Teresa, in her current merry state, shouted at the top of her lungs “--insert name here--!” She opened her arms high and wide, rushing towards the long-benched table where her son resided. Andy and Ifollowed in her quick step foot prints like a couple of drunken parrots.Teresa latched onto --insert name here-- and gave him a big smooch. “How many has she had?” --insert name here-- proclaimed. Andy and I looked at each other and shrugged; we would be hypocrites to Life Turned Upside Down110 of 156speak about her state of soberness. We all gathered around the table as the introductions were made.“For those who don’t know”, I think it was only me who this statement was aimed at, “this is my son--insert name here--” Teresa announced. --insert name here-- looked up sheepishly to acknowledge theintroduction. “This is Dave”, me, “my work mate at K J Ross. This is Andy my partner. Finally, this is Jon,an old work mate of mine” said Teresa. “Right, everyone knows who I am, how do we get drinks aroundhere?” Teresa asked. --insert name here-- piped up, “It’s table service, some German looking bloke willappear in a minute. He’ll take our orders.”Sure enough, a rotund Bavarian fashioned man with brown braced shorts appeared. Teresa again tookcharge, “shhh, I’m getting the drinks in. What does everyone want?” The drinks menu was extensivewith a large range of beers and spirits. The spirits were more schnapps based, with a variety of differentflavours to suit every northern European’s darkened tastes. The choices were bewildering; as every “onthe fence” person would do in our position we opted for the variety selection. Not one though variety,but many. As a Dark Bavarian Beer convert my thoughts were focussed on the Dark Beers section of thedrinks menu. It was here where I saw the familiar go to option. Knowing it was a Bavarian Beerestablishment I opted for the Stein measure, 1 metric litre of my favourite beer, Hofbrau Dunkel. As Iordered I felt an inner glow. Even if the schnapps were bad, the taste sensation that is Hofbrau Dunkelwould offset it.The drinks arrived duly; they were delivered in the world renouned Bavarian Style i.e., ridiculous numberof drinking receptacles delivered in one go.I held onto the stein glass like a comfort blanket. With effort and focus I raised said beer to the mouth. Iattempted to take a mouthful with some success. Unfortunately, some success doesn’t cut it on tablemanners front. Especially when some of the dark beer made its way onto the white work shirt. “That’sgoing to leave a mark” I thought. I wasn’t overly bothered; in fact I was quite happy with my efforts.Unfortunately, my efforts were noticed by the social strata around the table. Andy found my drinkingshenanigans hilarious, “Dave, ha ha, next time you should bring a bib!” his chuckle turning into a coughas sipped on his beer, which caused him to wear most of the said beverage. I returned the gaffaws andso did the rest of the table.Life Turned Upside Down111 of 156Teresa piped up “right, I’ve bought a selection of schnapps for everyone.” Indeed, the wooden shot glassholders were set up in front of us ready to be downed. Teresa picked up the left-most shot and exalted acheers, which prompted everyone to follow suit. We all lifted our first shot glass in unison, clinckedthem and said a cheers in return. The shot didn’t get a chance to touch the lips as it slid down the backof the throat. I took a reactionary look at the members on the table to get a feeling for what theythought. Thankfully it was a sweet peach schnapps, a drink that was dangerously easy to consume inlarge quantities and a pre-party favourite on many a lads holiday.We proceeded knocking back each shot in the same fashion. The pub began to fill up, much to ourbemusement; a band wearing Bavarian attire began setting up on stage with a range of brassinstruments. An air of excitement and anticipation filled the room as the band members began topractice. I was happy anchoring on to the Stein, which was now only partly full. Teresa piped up “whowants another?” Through the haze of my current state of vision I looked at the stein and over at Teresa.I slurred as I spoke “yeah T, another dark’n, por favour.” The round was swiftly ordered and returned toour tables in quick time as the start of the Bavarian Music Marvel band began to play their firstconcurrent notes.The Bier Keller began to pack out, every spot at a table was filled by a person mesmerised by the music.We swayed in unison as the “umm paa” rhythm began to take hold. I didn’t recognise a Germanic wordof the music they played until… They started playing the signature tune from the film Ground Hog Day,"Pennsylvania Polka" by Frank Yankovic. I engaged all singing apparatus and bellowed out my rendition.The intoxication feeling allowed me to follow the rhythm and attempt to sing along. The problem was Ididn’t know any of said lyrics, the best I could do was attempt to match the intonations. I felt like a smallchild attempting to communicate his/her feelings to an adult and feeling a sense of frustration. Theadult, in this case, was a member of Bavarian serving staff who approached our table with gusto. Hesmiled and asked “you German, you know this song?” I took this question to heart; I was pleasantlysurprised to receive praise, a stamp of approval from the motherland. I should have played the situationout but replied honestly to the server’s incredulities “I heard it on Ground Day.” With that the staffmember scooted off to the group next to us to take another drinks order.Life Turned Upside Down112 of 156The pride filled my soul; I pushed my chair back and directed my cheerful singing voice at the rest of ourgroup much to Teresa’s amusement. To complement the merriment our group began to sway in syncwith the rhythm. As the song ended I let out one last below from the depths of my vocal chards andcollapsed back into my seat. It was at that point I felt the tug of the alcohol as it began to overwhelm mysystem. I really had to concentrate on every single body movement and above all try and keep awake.“Right”, this time it was Andrew that conducted us, the drinking orchestra. “Onwards to Argyle!”The Argyle, located just around the corner was distinctly trendy. A bar in which is was common to see Cclass celebrities. As we arrived and queued I was aware of the bouncers; they looked at me with a senseof disgust. I was happy to be conscious enough to self-conscious. The look was enough for me to dig intomy self-consciousness and attempt to appear sober for the brief time we were confronted with thejudge, jury and executioners i.e., the bouncers. “How ya going? Had a good night so far?”, it was allrhetoric. “Looks like you’ve had a good night so far?” the bouncer asked. Teresa piped up, in acommanding serious manner she replied. “Yep, been great so far, it’ll be better when we get in it’sbleedin’ freezing out here.” The bouncers were taken aback by how confident and outspoken she was.Immediately their defences dropped, Teresa turned to the rest of us. Like a defeated army, the menmoved to one side and let us enter. The triumphant Teresa confidently turned to us and proclaimed“come on then, remember I’m buying.” The seriousness tone once again turning jovial. I walked over tothe nearest table and took a seat. My body slowly crumpled onto the table.“Right mate, you need to put some strength into those legs else we’re not going to be able to carryyou.” A voice said. In my semi-conscious state I looked around and noticed two big blokes, one eitherside of me. It took a few seconds for my brain to work out what was going on as I blindly tried to followtheir instructions. After making my way through the entrance archway to the street outside I wasgracefully laid down. “Mate, best advice, take a taxi home” the one bouncer instructed. I retorted with aslur “but my mates are in there.” I didn’t care a great deal in my current state. I wasn’t going to pay for ataxi, no way. Even in my drunken state I was tight on the purse strings. I needed to find a bus home, butwhere was home? I couldn’t honestly determine that side of the equation.Life Turned Upside Down113 of 156I managed to get to my feet and walk to the high street where I could see buses pass by. I looked hard atthe queue that had formed at the one bus stop. Given the length of said queue I was happy THIS was theone that would get me to where I needed to be. Wherever that was. A bus turned up, I fumbled for cashand presented it to the driver in exchange for a ticket. I found a free seat, sound down and passed out.My consciousness this time round was resuscitated by the driver. “Last stop mate” he said in a laidbacktone. My state of mind was a little more liberated at that point. I felt able to take in my surroundingsand direct a question to the driver “where am I?” The driver indicated I was somewhere that I had neverbeen to before or since. The driver asked “where do you need to get to?” I scraped the recesses of mymind for an answer to this question. It would have saved me a lot of time knowing the answer from theoutset of the bus journey. It was a light bulb moment, “Crows Nest” I blurted. “Jeez mate, you’re a longway from home. I’m heading back into the city after a short break here. It’s best if you stay on this busand take a taxi when you get into the centre. There aren’t any buses heading that way at this time ofnight” he instructed. With that I got to my feet, stretched and exited the bus.The overwhelming urge to defecate distilled thoughts of finding the nearest WC. I was clueless on whereone could be, looking around me and like a moth to a light I searched for a luminous sign. I took a 360degrees panorama of my surrounds. The only radiance I could perceive were the lights of the nearbyhomes. The idea of knocking on someone’s door and asking to use their facilities. As great as it sounds,the results could be mixed and possibly shocking for both parties. I looked further afield into the depthsof the darkness, to use as a veil. There I saw a flower bed, a befitting area for the fertilizer that it wouldbe experiencing.As it is with going for a number 2 in the wild, treachery does spring to mind. Even in a sober state “thesquat” position is not the easiest to hold. There is also the matter of balance, getting the non-essentialclothing out the way and the clean up task at the end. When performed correctly there is an element ofsatisfaction that elevates “the squat” beyond “the throne”.Life Turned Upside Down114 of 156The clean-up on this occasion was going to be in the “depths of my bowels”. As I found a suitablelocation I went through the motions with meticulous detail. What lessened the stress on the wholeexercise was a fence. A fence was located in front of the suitable location, which meant a more stableposition was going to be attainable. The bars of said fence brought a smile to my face as I clasped firmlyto them and went through the motions and bowel movements. I sighed a huge sigh of relief when the“demon was released”. A load was taken off both my mind and my waste system. What made my smiledeepen was the result, clean as a whistle, no scrupulous clean-up routine was required.With trousers up and belt tightened I swaggered confidently towards the bus that was soon to be setback in motion. I hopped onboard, sat down and looked out the window and smiled once more. The busengine roared into action as it headed citywards. The thought of getting home was an immenselysatisfying one and one which I was sober enough to rationalise and execute.

### The Boys Weekend

Johnny did a bloody good job of rounding up the troops, the lads from blighty, organising theaccommodation in a Surfers Paradise resort for 13 of us for 2 nights. Unlucky for some you could say. AAU\$100 bond was required for each room. The hotel had obviously latched onto the “lads holiday”theme of the occasion.Life Turned Upside Down115 of 156I was to pair up with my best British Expat bud Andy. All this and more was organised for mid-October.Surfers Paradise was renown for being a destination where the equivalent of A-Level students that hadfinished their exams flocked to, to basically overindulge in debauchery. It was also renowned for beingedgy. Edgy, which roughly translates to violent. People went to Surfers looking for trouble. The fact themain boulevard was filled with pubs and clubs i.e., places where drinking was brought into the mix,added to its blight.The group of Ex-pats, thankfully, weren’t of the violent persuasion. On arrival to Surfers Paradise wethrew our weekend apparel into the rooms and set out on an “all-dayer”.The stupid idea of staying out all day and drinking throughout much of it didn’t settle well on myconscious, especially after the “Darling Harbour” incident. Still I was happy to go with the flow. Therewas a split in the group’s thoughts on the days itinerary. On the one side was “The Johnny All-Day-er”,on the other was the “Carl Adventure Park Day”. I wasn’t a huge fan of either, and given the opt-in countthe former was a better option. As we stood in lobby, the split in activity groups evident I made a lastminute “3 amigos” check. Wallet, keys, phone… Phone!? Bugger, I’d left my only means ofcommunicating with the rest of the group on the bedroom table. I communicated this to the group inthe only way I knew, quietly to avoid embarrassment.I returned to lobby to find the binge drinking group was nowhere to be seen. Thankfully Carl and Mattwere present waiting for their taxi. I looked bemusedly at the lobby space. “Where is the rest of thegroup?” I asked. “They went off in taxis a few minutes ago, they didn’t know if you were going withthem so they took off” Carl replied. “Feel free to join us at the adventure park if you’re stuck foranything to do.” Carl suggested. I was grateful for the invite, even though it wasn’t an original plan ofmine.Life Turned Upside Down116 of 156The taxi eventually arrived at our hotel to our relief. The three of us piled in and off we set.The taxi ride took us across a landscape that was a far departure from that I’d seen in Sydney. The GoldCoast was more tropical than its bigger brother Sydney. Banana plantations and swamps passed by inthe reflection of the window. Even though it was mainly tamed by man’s hand, it still had that wild feelgiven the level of rainfall that had struck and sculpted its soils. It was then, much like the Gold Coast ingeneral, a shock to the system to see a Warner Brothers Movie World appear out of nowhere.The synonymous Warner Brothers logo was displayed on an art deco style arch that befitted a studiomore so than a theme park. It filled my childhood heart with comfort; I was brought up on theircartoons. I had much to thank them for the special memories that they engrained in my life. With asense of indebtedness, I was happy to fork out the silly ticket price. Carl was more tied in than me,expressing his love for the studio by paying that little bit extra for an additional access ticket.It was surreal walking the fake studio streets. There were pockets of families walking aroundentertained by individuals dressed up in costumes that symbolised Warner Brother cartoon characters.Shops selling a wealth of unhealthy foods and experiences were strategically positioned for maximum“fork out”. I felt out of place, 3, 30 something year old blokes walking around premises targeting theshortcomings of a child’s wants and needs. Carl, in his usual downbeat, sarcastic manner asked “so whatshall we do then? And don’t think about that?” he indirectly indicated. “What?” Matt and I replied.“There is a lot of jail bait around these parts. Don’t let your eyes wander.” he added. There were a lot ofteenage girls at the theme park and with it being Australia they wore very little, which was notsurprising given the warm conditions, but at the same time surprising given that the teenagers werewith family.Life Turned Upside Down117 of 156We retreated our perverted minds to the more epic side of the theme park, the roller coasters. Theolder I got the more thrills I seeked, but the more impatient I had become. Given that I looked for aqueue to a ride that offered a sub 5-minute wait time on an epic ride. The ride that met thisrequirement was the Superman escape. It looked standard enough from a roller coaster functionalperspective, forwards loop and round, reverse. My expectations, given my initial assessment of saidride, were tame. As Carl, Matt and I reached the front of the queue we sat in the passenger train. Theholster bars dropped down and the count down began. “Count down?!” Given my experience of rollercoasters in the past, the first few moments of a roller coaster ride were relaxed, steady and sometimesclunky. This wasn’t going to be the case on this ride. This realisation brought a smile to my face as Ijoined in on voicing the count-down.With many of the modern roller coaster rides the element that sells, the bring the people, the hugequeues, is the hype. The hype is related to the key moment the ride offers. The oblivion ride at AltonTowers in the UK had the moniker “don’t look down!”, this hype related to the free fall section of theride. Whatever signature was associated with Superman ride would have related to the start of theexperience, to be precise, after the count down.Not knowing the mechanics of the ride, the hype surrounding it, I was at its mercy. As the countdown to1 was announced in a deep, cinema-esque tone there was a short pause. I could sense somethingunexpectant was to happen. The manner in which the train was catapulted was immense. I felt a rush ofblood towards the back of the head as it was firmly planted against the headrest of the seat. The skin ofmy face was resembling a stretched pink balloon as the car accelerated forwards. My brain had littletime to contemplate the pleasure of this experience. At that very moment the endorphin rush had noequal in my living memory. As the ride continued through its twist and turns, it shortly came to an end.As the train slowed and the safety bar was released, I sat there. My eyes were open wide and my heartpounded. A member of staff signalled to me to remove myself from the seat. My blank stare andunfettered look on my face told the story. I looked down and shook my head to break my zombie-likestate. I carefully got to my feet and exited out into the bright nearby Warner Brothers street. My mindbegan to absorb everything that happened in the short period of time that constituted the Superman Life Turned Upside Down118 of 156experience. I began to smile, a less robotic, more humanoid state returned to my being. I turned andlooked at the Superman ride. I cross examined my memory with what I could see of the ride. Strangely,it was like looking at a foreign object. Nothing in my mind married up with the track I saw before me.Over stimulation unfortunately had its cons.My attention was distracted by a familiar voice. “Dave!”, the direction of the voice was located behindme. I turned to see a “happy” looking Carl and Matt, both were munching on chocolates bought fromone of many Warner Brothers retail shops. As I looked agast at the confectionary the first question that Ihad to ask was “how much did the Mars Bar cost?” I braced myself for the response. “Just a couple ofbucks” was the quipped response as Carl turned his attentions to his mobile phone. “Just had a textfrom Johnny, him and the lads are over at the Wet ‘n’ Wild. He was asking about our whereabouts. Wetand Wild. What do you think?” he asked. I was, as was the case with excursions organised by otherpeople, happy to go with the flow. Looking at Carl and Matt, both weren’t that fussed. Our WarnerBrother passes allowed us entry into Wet ‘n’ Wild, so it wasn’t going to be financially taxing. We agreed,for the sake of group unity, to meet Johnny and the rest of the pose.Wet ‘n’ wild was nothing over and above other waterparks. What it did have, given the location, washeat, sunshine and high UV. We showed our passes, entered and headed over to the main pool wheremost of the slides fed into. Johnny was the first to recognise us, shouting in his southern accent “lads!”We looked up and saw Johnny in his damp, baggy trunks looking a bit worse for wear.“Don’t ask. Well do, but the answer is going to be. Number one, re-apply sun cream, number two, don’twear sunglasses while tackling the rubber ring water slide.” Johnny said. The rest of the lads had decidedto save themselves for the night ahead by taking to the sun loungers. Johnny added that they wereready to make a move soon, but they needed to get changed and freshened up. I couldn’t speak for Carland Matt, but I was ready to head back to the hotel. I was just knackered from all the standing andqueueing. “Well, I’m tired from all the standing and queueing I’ve experienced today” Carl said, as if hehad read my mind. Matt and I concurred. Carl continued “Right, it looks like we’re all a little worse forwear. We’ll see you back at the hotel Johnny.” With that we headed to Wet ‘n’ Wild’s exit where wewaited for our taxi back.Life Turned Upside Down119 of 156The night kicked off with the expat team assembled in the hotel lobby ready to head into town. Wedecided to take the relaxed drinking approach. We found a bar with an outdoor seating area with comfychairs organised around many tables fused together to form a seamless tray with which to perch ourdrinking vessels. I could sense a number of the lads felt uneasy. The other halves in their lives had, let’ssay, constrained their lives somewhat in the balance of give and take. They looked around sheepishlyhalf expecting the lady in their life to appear from out of the blue and attach the leash.Many though, unusually enough included Andy, Johnny and Carl, seemed well at ease with theenvironment. Carl, known for his womanising, jocular comments, had one eye on his schooner andanother on any unsuspecting female that would drift past. There was an intensity to his degradingcomments that added to their comical nature. He wouldn’t dare comment in the same manner in thepresence of his girlfriend. In that situation he preferred to praise his lady friend, but subtly hint to hismale friends that whatever was occupying his periphery was, to use a culinary analogy, delicious.Around the lads he would add mannerisms to assert his male, testosterone driven urges. Sniffing the airand gesticulating with his tongue were hallmark Carl-isms.I was happy to laugh along at Carl’s antics. His humour was typically British, with an added rudeness thatI’m sure Aussies would appreciate. Andy was giggling along like a Hyena on heat, which added moredrama to Carl’s jokes. Johnny, the leader of the pack, was deeply involved in conversation with mates ofhis at the other end of the table. I could sense his unease, which comes with the lad’s drinking party leadrole. Being in such a position before, there was the added pressure of finding the right moment to moveon. I think most of us could have sat at the table until closing time, such was the relaxed environment.Johnny had other ideas, his ideal night wasn’t a relaxed one, he wanted to see the bright lights andexperience the pounding sounds of the club scene. As he got out of his chair and rubbed his handstogether he hailed to the rest of the group “Right lads! Drink up, we’re moving.” “Where to?” Carlexclaimed. “Well, we could sit around here, scratch our arses and make it back to the hotel. OR we couldliven the night up and get our boogy on at some debaucherous club setting.” I read Carl’s frustration likea paragraph of facial braille. The rest of the group looked at Carl in his Harumphed state, “Come on Carl,it won’t be that bad.” Andy advised. Carl looked to me, quickly looked round then whispered hisintended next move. “There’s a descheveled strip club that I saw a couple of blocks away, what do yousay to a bit of…” He winked, and gesticulated the universal hand gestures for sex.Life Turned Upside Down120 of 156I felt more in debt to Carl than any other member of the group. He’d been a great friend in the shorttime that I had known him. Why he felt such an attachment was anyone’s guess. Given that, I was happyto go with his flow and abandon the rest of the group, even if it meant upsetting them This was morepreferable than upsetting Carl, that I knew hated the club scene and was forthcoming with his feelingsto Johnny. Johnny didn’t seem too bothered by Carl’s abhorrence. Once Johnny was happy to part wayswith Carl, it opened the door for me to then join him on his sex-capade.Having only consumed a few beers we were all but sober by the time we got to the entrance of Silks.Like many strip clubs in the UK, the entrance was unassuming, giving very few indications of theshenanigans that went on behind these closed doors. In many ways it added to the tease that thesedives portrayed.We made our way past the bouncer and immediately into the dark reception area. It was here that afrantic and cohesively confident lady asked us for our id and an entrance fee. I could sense that Carl wasexcited, a rush of blood from the head made Carl more charitable. He was happy to pay the entrance feefor both him and me. I happy put my wallet back into my jean’s pocket and looked towards the doorsthat separated us from the bar area.As Carl and I swung the doors open it was dark and dead… We looked at each other, towards the vacantstage and then towards the bar. “Right, let’s get royally ratted!” Carl exclaimed. I smiled, nodded andaccompanied him to the bar. “2 Yaeger bombs please” he said to the bar staff. They arrived swiftly,clinked and consumed even faster. I indicated to Carl that I was getting the same drinks round in. Heslowly nodded agreeably as the next round perched itself on the edge of the bar.Life Turned Upside Down121 of 156As the fifth round of Yaeger bombs were swiftly consumed the mood changed. It was like the scene inMichael Jackson’s Moonwalker movie/music video when Michael steps into the club, stops, flicks a coininto the jukebox and the dancefloor action begins. In this case, somehow the placement of the shotglass onto the bar area coincided with the strip dancer’s dancefloor being lit up like a Christmas Tree.The modern, upbeat music pounded its way through the whole club, and resoundingly, the whole of theGold Coast.My eyes focussed on the criss-cross of multicolour orbs that mechanically pierced the dancefloor. This,as I had experienced in the past, was the first tease. The punters were made to wait, purposefully, forthe first show girl to arrive. It felt like an eternity, but then, like a magician’s entrance in a puff of smoke,there she was. My jaw dropped, I was in awe at the sheer quantity of show girl present on stage. Beingsexually attracted to curvaceous women with large breasts, this lady reeled my attentions in like linecaught cod. I was hooked; my cravings for her were intense resulting in an endorphin rush.The dancer’s routine was a mix bag, being less agile due to the size of her appendages she worked thefloor more. Still, she had a decent grasp of the pole. I turned to Carl and nodded, he looked at me withwide eyes and a mixture of suggestive sexual body gestures. I laughed and drew my attentions oncemore to the dance floor to see continue my drunken admiration.When her act completed I could see that she was making her way through the “viewing area”attempting to get the attention of potential customers. I gave one glance over at Carl, looked in theshow girl’s direction and said “I need to get a private dance from her”. I’ll see you soon.I got the attentions of said show girl quickly with a wide-eyed stare and an abrupt “hey, private dance?How much?”. I hadn’t been so concise in all my years. She replied with a money figure related to a 3length of time options; I demanded the lengthiest. As I handed over the “reddies”, with money Life Turned Upside Down122 of 156concealed in her purse she asked me to sit back and relax. As I watched her take off her clothes out thecorner of my eye I saw Carl walk by, hand in hand, with another token lady.GG, probably a reference to her bra size, forced her enormous breasts into my face. Knowing how stripclubs operate I was careful look and not touch. It can be difficult given my level of arousal in thesituation. I “played it by feel” as the saying doesn’t go. I caressed her breasts using all the fleshyimplements I had exposed. Thankfully there was no push-back; as she worked her routine I was gettinglots of value from the money she’d banked. I knew it was a tease, but it was one of the best sexualteases I had experienced in my life. If only this was a non-work situation, which is what a lot of stupidpeople, me included, believe can be segued to if the timing is right.As I spoke to her I had to curtail my sexual intentions. As much as I wanted to have sex with her I knew,deep down that this was all an act that I should just play along with.When the striptease finished I walked contentedly to the bar area to see if I could find Carl. I smiled tosee him walk past with girl number 2 in hand, heading to the private dance area at the back of the club.I ordered a beer and looked dancefloor-wards once again to see more of the breadth of “talent” thatwas on offer. I was happy in the knowledge that the money I had spent on the private dance was moneywell spent. With that I was happy to make an exit, but not without the good ship Carl who was stilloccupied.Life Turned Upside Down123 of 156My drink was reaching the dregs stage as Carl returned, smile plastered across his “boat race”. He saidto me “fancy making a move?” I nodded and winked, indicating to him the level of debauchery we hadjust experienced.As it had reached the end of the night it was that time. The ritual that my friends and I would follow atthe end of a night, that I imposed on Carl, was the end of night kebab. Thankfully the Gold Coast cateredfor this event with a plethora of “Kebab Houses” dotted along the main hub on the way back to thehotel. It was always going to be a dicey experience in the early hours heading to the kebab shop. Carland I witnessed random fights, the ferocity of which took us by surprise. It was going to be a grab andeat en-route to the hotel to try and avoid this situation.With luggage assembled in the hotel lobby the group looked sheepish. The withdrawn looks wereattributed to a night on the tiles that didn’t meet the expectations of well versed Sydney-side drinkers.There were, according to the bright words of Johhny, a lack of drinking holes and a lack of “talent” withwhich to ogle over. As was the case for Carl and I, on our journey back to the hotel on the night, a largenumber of trouble makers. They obviously spilled out of the pubs and clubs that Johnny and party hadvisited.On hearing of Johnny’s bad night experience it reinforced my sense of fulfilment. Carl and I, chose abetter late-night option, albeit being the seedier of the two groups plans. Carl and I glanced at eachother and smirked, indicating a school boy immaturity related to the smut we experienced on theprevious night. Johnny turned to Carl and me to ask “how was your night?” To which Carl replied, “it wasalright”. I knew deep down that Carl loved every second of it; he looked like a cat that had the cream.I’m sure that his girlfriend Uma was to hear nothing of the experience; appropriating the adage “whathappens on tour, stays on tour.”

### Smiffy and Kris Visit

Much was up in the air with regards to life in Sydney come November. I was still waiting for the nod tomove to Melbourne from Mark and I was living in accommodation here (Kings Cross) there (CrownHotel, Surry Hills) and everywhere. Accommodation needs did stabilise somewhat when KJRA did a bitmore homework to re-house me after I sent an email begging for Serviced Apartment accommodation.The next major event before the big move was, my friend’s arrival. Matthew and Kris were all set to visiton November 22nd. They were living in the UK at the time with a eye to move to the Netherlands.Anyway, it had been months in the making, organising an itinerary for an epic Western Australia Tripthat would begin in on November 26th, starting in Broome and ending in Perth.I hoped by the time they arrived the Serviced Apartment Accommodation would come through.Life Turned Upside Down125 of 156Work in Sydney was thin on the ground towards the end of the year across all offices. It was noticeablyan issue when Mark, Chief Operations Officer, dialled in from the office in Queensland to give a weeklyupdate. Everyone, other than one consultant, was “on the bench” over in Melbourne (my soon to benew home). We didn’t have many consultants here in Sydney, which was took the pressure of Bruce, thesales man. Elliot, the alternate Sydney salesman, appeared to always be in a client role. He and Jason (aperformance test expert) were making waves over at CBA, Commercial Bank Australia. Mr Playford hadmoved on to bigger things; only Andy Schevchenko and I were left to man the desks in the small Sydneyoffice. Andy and I were both waiting for the start of the BIG project. This was a piece of work that wasinitiated by Bruce, having a contact there, and Teresa who drove the Test Strategy onsite.There was a lot going on in November with friends in Australia and in the UK. Tony, a close friend ofmine was in the process of organising the stag do for another close friend of mine, Rob. I was asked tobe joint best man alongside Tony, but this responsibility I unfortunately had to decline given myAustralia based location. I also, given my location and change in dates (the original dates would haveallowed me to partake in the stag do and be present at Rob’s wedding) have to decline the invite to theproposed stag do.Matthew and Kris sent over details of their flight to Sydney, due to arrive on Saturday 20th November.Their return date was December 13th departing from our final destination together, Perth in WesternAustralia. Their flight to and from the UK was an epic one, 20 hours in total!Life Turned Upside Down126 of 156The day, 20th November, came when my good friends were to arrive at Sydney Airport. At the time Iwas working over in a suburb of Sydney called Pyrmont. The company I was working for, Viocorp, were astartup-come-small business. Their working schedule was thankfully relaxed. A look online confirmedthat Matthew and Kris’s flight was on time. I was all set to make the easy, but pricey, train journey tothe airport to ensure my friends were welcomed with open arms.I found the arrivals area looked sheepishly at the electronic board. I double checked my iPhone for theirflight details and cross checked it with the board information. Yep, the fight has landed; it looked like itmight be a bit of time before they get through customs and baggage reclaim. Fingers crossed there wereno holdups. My nervousness began to elevate.As I waited with arms crossed in the “welcoming party” arrivals area, a set of doors flung open. A rush ofpassengers with trolleys and baggage emerged. For that moment, as I scanned the group, I couldn’t see Life Turned Upside Down127 of 156Matthew or Kris. Then, like a bolt of lightning, _bang_ I clocked them. My nervous demeanour began tosoften and smooth into a more relaxed, open posture. Matthew approached first with a huge smile onhis face. “Alright mate” he said as his “on-the-fence” hug turned into a handshake offering. The took theinvite with firm reciprocation. Kris looked a little tired, effortfully she gave a hug, which I warmlyaccepted. I looked at their weighty luggage and asked if I could help. The independent duo were happyto keep lug around the baggage, which made me feel slightly uneasy given I had nothing but the clotheson my back to transport from the airport to my flat.Matthew took charge. “Right, lead the way?” he enthusiastically exclaimed. Being a frequent flier, I washappy to show the couple the Sydney ropes and hopefully keep them awake. “Follow me” I said, lookingup at the signs directing to the train station. I introduced a dose of travel small talk into the conversationto keep my friends at ease. “How was your flight?” “Did you get much sleep?” I asked. Matthewanswered first, his answer focussed on the in-flight entertainment offerings. Kris followed lessenthusiastically, mummering something or other about one of the films she had watched.On the long approach to the train station I began mentioning the lucrative train ticket arrangement atthe airport. I only wished I was pre-warned when I first flew into Sydney. There is an extra cost to usingthe airport train station, basically a toll given the government had borrowed money to pay for itsconstruction. Every time a passenger wanted to pass through the gate their they had to pay the costtrain fare from A to B and also purchase an additional ticket that allowed them through the airport trainstation barriers. Given that a lot of people using the Airport Train Station were passengers it felt unfairthat foreigners should be paying for this Australian construction.Life Turned Upside Down128 of 156I was to find out that Kris and Matthew were on a tight budget and this extra fee was came early andbegin frustrating early too. Me, trying to be the perfect host didn’t want this stink to be anywhere nearmy friends. It couldn’t be avoided, and I couldn’t afford to pay for it on their behalf given my spendingattitudes at that time.My tired and frustrated friends belligerently paid the fee and followed me to the platform for the nexttrain. I tried to stay ambivalent while my bellicose friends slumped their luggage on the floor. Krisuttered something under her breath to release her frustrations. I felt nervous, looking up at the onscreen train timetable to guage when the next train was arriving. Unfortunately, the next train was agood 15 minutes away… I took a look at my phone to see if anything even remotely interesting couldtake me away from the car crash that was the “train station” predicament.Like a Mighty Mouse moment, an email appeared like a bolt from the blue. It was from Carl; he asked ifthe Brit-pack group would like to meet up at The London Pub over in Paddington on an evening duringthe week. My eyes lit up as I read the finer details, not because it was going to be special night out. Itwas a means of offering some relief from the envisaged pressures of trying to keep my friendsentertained. I hoped this news would break some the ice that had begun to form between myself andKris and Matthew.Life Turned Upside Down129 of 156I looked up from my phone, smiled and began selling the idea of a night out involving them and my Expat friends. Matthew (or Smiffy as referred to him internally) being a socialite was very much up forsome social action. Kris, on the other hand was happy to follow Matthew’s social lead. She “baa-ed” herapproval while looking sheepishly down at her feet.I looked up at the on-screen train timetable and saw the 15 minutes that I had saw last had some downto a digestable 2-minutes, which turned to 1-minute and with that the impeding sound of the doubledecker train. Relief came to my every sinew as the train pulled in and stopped at the platform. Theimpressive double decker train (not so impressive for Kris, given the splendid train service employed inthe Netherlands) was a modern affair. The train had been employed as part of the transport system toaccommodate passengers using the train network when the Olympics graced the city back in 2000. TheOlympics money also turned the fortunes of the poorer suburb of Homebush, which funnily enoughwould become a residence of mine as the move to Melbourne debacle ensued.Life Turned Upside Down130 of 156As we approached Wynyard Station I looked over at Matthew and Kris. Jet lag and a dose of Sydneysunshine had definitely caught up with them looking at their closed eyes and lifeless bodies. I smiled, butknew my original plans of going for a few drinks would need to be delayed until they had some properrest.Only one connecting remained to reach Crows Nest I could then “drop the friends off”. The ride intoCrows Nest was an impressive one by any cities standards. The Sydney Bay area is arguably one of theprettiest and most iconic views to grace any city. The train passed over Sydney Harbour Bridge to affordsuch views. Even though Matthew and Kris were tired I could see their eyes light up as we approachedour final stop. Funnily enough, given the frequency I had passed over the Sydney Harbour bridge Idismissed what I saw before me.I was happy to see the flat and happy I had apartment accommodation to use while my friends werehere. It would afford Matthew and Kris the privacy and space they needed while they acclimatised. Iopened the door to the apartment and waved my arm in the direction of the bedroom-come-loungecome-kitchen-come-living room. It was clean as a whistle thanks to the cleaners giving it the weeklyonce over. I had placed a sh\*t load of flyers on the table to give them options during their stay. I also letthem use the comfy double bed, which would hopefully allow them to get the recuperation theyneeded. I handed the spare key to them, wrote down my phone number and said that they should callme on this number (pointing at piece of paper) to get in contact with me. With that I made a beeline forthe apartment exit. I had to get back to work pronto and make sure I got in a full day’s work over atViocorp.Life Turned Upside Down131 of 156The day at work was a blur, I was understandably not focussed on it. My thoughts were shadowed by myfriends being here, which supplied a sharp hit of nervousness to the system. I wanted their trip to beperfect but being the pessimist, I thought so far it wasn’t. After 3 hours of work my phone lit up with amessage from Matthew. The two of them felt somewhat rested and wanted to meet up with me afterwork. They asked for recommendations. Given Viocorp’s proximity to Darling Harbour it was stupid ofme not to recommend meeting up at its greatest drinking venue, The James Squire Brewhouse over atDarling Harbour. I knew the bar well, it also being the last memory before breaking my many teeth.James Squire Brewhouse was packed on the evenings and it was no surprise given its mixture of largescreen live sporting events and the plethora of beers it supplied to its punters. It was there that I triedwhat was arguably the closest brew they had to Guinness. From time to time they would produce one ofbrews for joe public and it was by chance such a brew was available. With the Ecstasy of Gold tuneplaying in my mind I ambly texted back to Matthew to ask him and Kris to meet me outside said pub.The sun twinkled in the harbour water below as I crossed the bridge that led from Paramatta to DarlingHarbour. The velvety surface smoothly ebbed and flowed as it glanced the wooden harbour’s woodendock. The comfortable, albeit humid, heat of the day was radiating more from the paving than from thesun itself. I looked over at the James Squire Brewhouse to admire its open bar grace as it commanded aprominent view. Smiffy and Kris weren’t around, a buzz on my phone had confirmed their late running.Coordinating themselves in the post flight haze must have been an exhaustive effort.Life Turned Upside Down132 of 156I was happy to grab a schooner of the James Squire Guinness equivalent and nurse it while I waited inthe comfort of the outdoor seating area. The red of the sun’s rays reflected off the water and onto myface forcing me to reach for my sunnies, which I had ready atop my head for such a predicament. Withthe Oakley’s doing a splendid job of filtering out the harmful rays I was once again able to continue withmy moment of relaxation.As I ambly stretched my neck I saw a familiar couple walking towards me. Smiffy and Kris looked muchmore relaxed having showered and changed into their summer wears. I could see a hint of a smileappear across Kris’s face for the first time. I smiled in reciprocation, standing up tall, having acquired a“drinker’s perch” position on the table that I assumed. I asked them the bloody obvious, but it was inkeeping with being the host, “do you fancy a drink?” Which should have warranted the response “doesDolly Parton sleep on her back”, or words to that effect.Life Turned Upside Down133 of 156Matthew was somewhat knowledgeable of the drinks that were available behind the bar, but this wasno ordinary Aussie Bar from back home. The Brewhouse’s selection of beers on tap extended past “theusual” fosters and Tooheys. Kris, having lighter tastes was happy for me to suggest a beer for her.Matthew, on the other hand, was mesmerised by the selection of beers and wanted something a littlemore like the lagers back from the mother land. I knew exactly what to get them and I’m sure they’dappreciate everything other than the more “off-piste” dark ales.We took the drinks over to an area outside the Brewhouse where we could stand, ogle at people as theypassed by and absorb the last of the sun’s rays as it made its decent. It was some life that I was leading,there was little in life to touch the relaxing, soothing experience of a social drink in dry, warm conditionswith the sea as a backdrop. I asked Matthew and Kris how they were feeling. They replied with moreenergy than the sapped couple I had picked up from the airport; It was great to feel their optimistic vibe.I was equally excited about Matthew and Kris enjoying themselves as I was about visiting WesternAustralia with them. As we ambly sipped our drinks we chatted about their relaxed day and their plansfor the rest of the week while they were here in Sydney. It seemed that a visit to the Blue Mountainswas on the cards for day 2!Kris and Matthew had returned from their day trip and I had happily returned from a yawnful day atwork in Pyrmont. Andy and his girlfriend at the time Christine Cullen were up for pre-drinks food at theCoco Cubana close to the venue. Unfortunately, my friends didn’t have the same enthusiasm for eatingout, having spent the day spending ample sums of money on tourist trap retail.Life Turned Upside Down134 of 156Matthew, Kris and I went to a nearby supermarket and picked up a wealth of healthy food to eat back atthe flat. Mangos were definitely in season given their ridiculously cheap price and perfect maturity.Being quite large I brought only a couple back for us to consume. The rest of the dinner ensembleconsisted of salad food items such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and the salty tasting Aussie cookedchicken. It didn’t take us long to consume, get ready and begin walking over to the nearby bus stop tocatch the 200 bus to Woollahra.With it being a comfortable, beau-tiful day, getting around Sydney was no dramas whatsoever. I wasslightly nervous taking my “old friends” over to see my “new friends”. I didn’t have any other options athand. Anyway, it would be a good distraction. It’s tiring being the host, especially when like me youworry about your guests not being happy. Having caught up with Matthew and Kris’s antics from theconversations over the past couple of days I was now into the closed, infrequent question portion of thehost-guest relationship. Looking out the bus window I was consumed by random thoughts. I thought tomyself “I could ask my friends about that, but do I really care about the answer?” My reflection in thebus window caught my attention like a butterfly catching the attention of a innocent child. I am a vainperson especially when it comes to my appearance. I wasn’t looking my best, a little dogged one couldsay, the squinting didn’t help as the full force of the sun on the horizon shone into face.Anxiety took a hold as I looked down at my iPhone to see where the bus was on the route. Another 10stops it reconned, which according to its estimate would take all of 5 minutes. I looked down again,“shit, this is our stop” I thought as I clambered to hit the stop button. I indicated to Matthew and Kris tobegin our imminent departure. Matthew and Kris smiled as we hopped off and followed me, who waseyes deep in the Google Maps app. I spoke out loud as I ran gestured to it “we’re here and the LordDudley is…”. We walked up the hill and crossed the road to behold the red brick, black wood on whitewall façade. The Lord Dudley wouldn’t look out of place in any 20th Century town.We walked inside and saw the familiar looking British pub set up. Wooden stools lined the bar area,cushioned wooden bench lay in the corners situated next to a decorated fire place. It was a place ofbeauty and a comforting bosom in which to aquaint Matthew and Kris. It was apparent that my Ex-pat Life Turned Upside Down135 of 156mates had commandeered a good portion of the pub’s interior acre-age. I looked over to see Christine,Andy, Johnny, Carl, Uma and few of their attachments. I smiled as they indicated their proximity to us.As we walked over, the skilled socialite Carl took the lead with a cheesy smile and an offering of a handshake to Kris and Matthew. “Pleased to meet you” he said enthusiastically with a smug and sincere smileslapped across his face. It was a side of Carl I remember experiencing way back when I first met him,what seemed like “many a moon ago” over in Manly. He began introducing the ex-pats to Kris andMatthew in a smooth open manner. “Cool” I thought, “my friends are like new play things to keep thegroup occupied, all I need to do is get the drinks in and relax. Thanks Carlos, you beauty!” I asked thegroup, as British convention dictates, if anyone wanted a drink. Looking around at the state of people’sdrinks, people had only just arrived before us. Andy though had a thirst on, indicating his schooner wassoon in need of refill. He looked at me in an undecisive manner and said “go on then, I’ll have anotherBecks.” “Anyone else?” I said, knowing there was very little chance of any more “double fist-ers”. Withthat I turned to my friends, indicating for them to head up to the bar with me to choose their poison.There was more than a hint of familiarity to the choice of beers on tap:Beck’sBudweiserGuinnessVBLife Turned Upside Down136 of 156CascadeBulmersCastlemaineCoopersAsahiToohey’sSpeckled HenLife Turned Upside Down137 of 156Being a fan of the British real ale scene, I was all over the Speckled Hen, whilst Matthew and Kris took aliking to the refreshing taste of the Australian beverages. “One Speckled Hen, a VB and a Toohey’splease? (barman)”.Matthew, Kris and I made our way back to the “comfy seats” in the corner of the main bar area withdrinks in hands. The “three-pint picker” hand position was put to good use as I delivered the beers.Thanks to the Matthew and Kris being our hosts, I was allowed to sit with them on the comfyupholstered, high back benches. The group was so used to embracing new-comers, with the Sydneysocial scene being so transient, it took next to no time for Kris and Matthew to become part of thegroup. The conversation was high-brow too, which somewhat surprised me given Carl was the driver ofthe group. Saying that, Uma was on hand to censor any “off-piste” comments that he could possibly say.Carl was a literary genius and was well versed in dictating the ebb and flow of chat within a group. Aftersaying something controversial in the presence of Uma, he would turn to her and offer a morsel ofgratitude to her that she would lap up. Carl knew his boundaries.The conversation had a remarkably laid-back tone to it. The people that were present simply got on andthose of the ex-pat group, that were absent, can rock the boat. It was especially true when Becks,Johnny’s girlfriend/mate joined us. As lovely as she is, she and her friend Charley were great at windingup Andy’s girlfriend Chris.Talking of rocking the boat, my old flatmate Becky that would sometimes make an appearance for ourget togethers was not one to mess with. She may have been diminutive in size, but authoritarian instature. She, like Carl, was a master of social interactions. Becky was able to read a situation and be ableto apply a “best of breed” course of action. It was her day job, she was Public Relations Manager forSony Entertainment Australia. Her role, unfortunately or fortunately, would mean she was required inmost client situations, inside and outside working hours. She was a great friend to have and an asset inall social situations. It was rare that she was available for the Ex-pat group situations given that.Life Turned Upside Down138 of 156I felt really comfortable during the pub get-together and I could see Matthew and Kris were relaxed andhaving fun too. “Phew” I thought, “success”. The night drew to a close quickly, as great nights always do.It was time for Kris, Matthew and I to bid farewell to my new friends before exiting to the humidity ofthe Sydney streets for our walk back to the train station.Smiffy and Kris complimented me for having such an awesome group of mates here in Sydney. It wastrue, but if only they knew about the darker side to their personalities. I smiled, I realised momentarilythat all I the expat friends were, were surrogates. I tersely tried to explain that to Matthew and Kris,which left them with a feeling of incredulity, which was to be expected given how outlandish it musthave seemed. Still, it had only been a year since I last spent time with my close friends, yet they felt asclose as they ever had been, thanks (as I was to find out) our connection through the social drinking.Social drinking bound me to most of my close friends, which would over the course of years, becomeour unbinding.So the day came to pack the bags, again for Matthew and Kris and head, to er… Melbourne. This wassomewhere that was on Matthew’s bucket list more than anyone elses. Having already visited recentlyto source a new flat I was somewhat familiar with the territory.Matthew and Kris were on a shoestring budget, which for me was a great thing as the West CoastAustralia trip was going to cost a fortune. Our abode in Melbourne was a hostel; we paid over the oddsfor a 4-bunk bed share. Thankfully, no one would be taking the spare bunk, so it was ran-sacked toaccommodate our luggage.Life Turned Upside Down139 of 156The memory of Melbourne was a faded one. The weather was not the best at the end of November, rainswept by, which meant we’d be getting good mileage out of our raincoats.The flight over to Broome, Western Australia, the beginning point of our trip, was always going to be alengthy one. The flight was a good 8 hours (including a stop at Perth Airport). It took all of 8 hours butgiven the excitement of the impending road trip it would not sullen our mood.On arrival at Broome Airport it was somewhat apparent that this was no international airport. Therunway was a mixture of tarmac and red sand. The departures and arrivals areas were one and thesame, housed in a tin roof shelter. For all its quirks it was great to have finally arrived and thetemperature, on initial sampling, was bloody lovely given the inclemency of the Melbourne weather weleft behind.All we needed to do was find the van hire company, Wicked Campers. Thankfully prior to the trip I hadsourced the location of the Wicked Vans, but my estimates were a little off. Thankfully the “short” walk,was a 5 minute taxi ride. On arrival we were welcomed by a raft of graffitied vehicles. The graffiti, I’msure, was not politically sensitive even to the average Australian. It could be seen as art, but “beauty is inthe eye of the beholder” as they say.Wicked Campers, like many old vehicle hire companies, were not the cleanest of environments to be in.Everyone working there had grease, oil and probably chip fat streaming across their exposed skin.Walking towards the office, entering the main entrance to the workshop, there were even morevehicles. These ones though needed a bit more care and attention by the state of their parts.Life Turned Upside Down140 of 156Having found a representative we signed the paper work and were led outside to the forecourt. “Right,this is yours.” I stared at the vehicle for what seemed like an interminable period of time, cross my arms,tilted my head and absorbed what I saw before me. It was a Mitsubishi, not any Mitsubishi, a Japanesespecial 4x4 diesel van called the Delica. It was tall, thin and by all masculine vehicles of this type,feminine. The representative explained that there was a knack to starting the engine. “Remember, it’s adiesel. Make sure the glow plug light goes out before you start the engine.” These would be wise words,and something that would forever be in the back of our minds when the Delica would manage tomisbehave first thing in the morning when started from cold.I was going to be designated first driver, being the host. Our first destination was to be the KimberleyKlub, YHA, just around the corner.We made our way south to nice little campsites along the way stopping at Captain BertMadigan Park - anice little camp site, red sands outdoor shared “bbq” area (I place the word bbq in inverted commasbecause the aussies use glorified, gas powered hot plates). There were loads of benches, a nice littlecreek and an array of large creepy crawlies that, like the wombles, were attracted to human left-overs.We headed to nearby Karijini Park along a corrugated track, which took a certain skill to ensure we weretravelling at just the right speed in order to not feel every bump. The canyons were shallow, lush andcontained little pools. It was our first encounter with a snake. I’d already lived in Australia for a year andhadn’t encountered a snake until that moment. Thankfully the reptile didn’t have us on it’s meal plan.Nonetheless it was swift and a good size. We found out that it was a Mulga Snake, the park rangerconfirmed our sighting. It is supposedly the largest venomous snake in Australia.The weather was, as the British would describe it, mildly moist which meant having to dig out thewaterproofs. Thankfully on the evening it didn’t rain in Karijini. The moisture did result in the soilsticking to the underside of the tent however. Life Turned Upside Down141 of 156On the night we opened the van boot, which like the tardis, was an immense space. It was where thefood preparation mastery happened. We had use of a small gas canister and stove, which on that nightallowed Kris to prepare dinner: penne with spinach and a creamy sauce. Beautiful.A good dusting off of the tent the next morning meant it was good to safely chuck in the boot. Karijiniwas even brighter and more beautiful than the day prior. It allowed us to be a bit more frugal withwhere we could go and what routes we could take.On exiting the park and its red sand tracks it was a joy to hit the tarmac of the sealed roads. With Kris atthe helm of the van I was allowed to relax in the back and watch the outback roll by. It was impressivelooking out and experience the sheer depth of the landscape. The scale of Australia is immense and flatover out west by the national park. It was barren, at times we did not see a vehicle for hours. A peacefulas it was, that would be no fun if the delicate Mitsubishi van were ever to break down.On the way to Exmouth we stopped off at a caravan park where we experienced Australia’s largestflightless bird, the emu. It’s a nerve-wracking experience coming face to face with a bird that is not fazedby your presence. The reason the large birds hung around was again because of sustenance. We hadpicked up water melon from a food stall that day, and like flies to poo, they couldn’t keep away from us.Leaving the last of it to them in order to save ourselves from being pecked to pieces.We headed to Coral Bay, a pristine lagoon on the way to our next stop, Exmouth. Coral Bay was special;forget the great barrier reef. It was here where, in pristine swimming conditions one could experienceclear waters, untouched corral reefs and a raft of colourful fish. All this was accessible from the shore! It Life Turned Upside Down142 of 156would have been perfect, unfortunately Kris scraped her foot on one of the reefs which prematurelysuspended her snorkelling experience for the day.Exmoor was a return back to the world of creature comforts, having consumed much of our car supplies.With it being December 2nd, Kris being full of festive cheer in un-festive weather found it appropriate topurchase a Santa hat at one of the supermarkets.We took time to relax on the rocky and sandy façade of the beaches around Exmoor. One morning Idecided to take a better look around town and see what activities were available that day. Luck had it,there was a scuba diving and snorkelling excursion from Ningaloo reef that was departing in theafternoon.Transport to Ningaloo was thrown in as part of the hefty cost of the trip, which put off Matthew andKris. Thankfully they were happy enough for me to travel on my lonesome; thankfully I wouldn’t bealone aboard the vessel, rubbing shoulders with a Scandanavian couple and an Aussie from the eastcoast.The speed boat could have easily accommodated 10 – 20 people. There were 4 of us, which made thewhole experience that bit more relaxed. Having a selection of coffee, teas and biscuits made it evenmore chilled out. The scuba diving and snorkelling was sublime; at the bottom of the clear blue waterswe could look up and see white tipped sharks circle overhead. Even though they were small I wasnervous, this being my first underwater visual encounter with the species. I was a lot happier when thegroup gathered around a rock formation, using it for cover as we knelt down and observed. The sharkscame to this particular area, along with many other different marine animals, to have their bodyscleansed by the small fish that lived there. It was just like the nature documentaries portrayed. The largeanimal would circle, and like a plane ready to land at London Heathrow, it would take it’s turn to circle Life Turned Upside Down143 of 156lower to the rocks. There the “servicing” fish would swim to reveal themselves from the nooks andcrannies of the rocks to feed on the large animal’s parasites.I could have knelt there all day on the prisitine sandy sea bed. However, there was an even biggersurprise to be had on the second part of the excursion. “Swimming with Manta Rays” was what this partwas billed as. The only element missing was the Manta Ray. Yep, there were plenty of distant greenturtles that the staff pointed out, but no rays. Ah well, it was looking like the tide was against us,literally, but then… An enthusiastic yelp from the captain meant it was time, quick sharpish, to get ourfins and snorkelling attire on before diving in to experience our new animal encounter.As described by the leader of the group, we shouldn’t get to close to the animal, even though this mantaray was a good 5 metres wide, they were easily spooked. So in our diamond formation around theManta Ray, we observed. The ray was so slow, so graceful as calmly beat its wings to propel itselfthrough the clear, shallow waters. It was awesome being so close to such a massive creature. It was onlybecause of prior animal documentary knowledge that I knew I was in the company of a somethingunthreatening. Even still, I felt somewhat anxious in its presence.The group leader then manoeuvred herself closer to the Manta Ray, presumably the animal was morecomfortable in our presence. She began to swim on her back and approached close to the underside ofthe Manta Ray, looking into its massive filtering mandibles. The group leader beckoned each one of usto approach too and observe. I was hasty and initially dismissive of getting closer, but I dug deep. I swamcloser to the Manta Ray and tried the exact same manoeuvre as the group leader. With some effort Ipulled it off and was rewarded with a close-up view of the massive creature. The adrenaline rush wasintense, thrilling yet comfortable. Each member of the group took their turn to perform the same set ofactions. I wasn’t the only one of the group that felt that initial nervousness. I could see, through the eyesof the snorkelling masks that we were all were ecstatic in being in the presence of this amazing animal.And then in a swifter flap of her wings, the Manta Ray was gone, into the outer reaches of the reef.Life Turned Upside Down144 of 156As we got on board the boat and caressed the freshly brewed cups of tea we smiled. The boat nowheading for the dock; we reflected on an amazing experience, one I’m sure will live with us for the restof our lives.Hamlin Pool is an amazing place with an equally significant back story. The extensive informationpresented on the information boards mentioned Stromatolites. They are the oldest and largest livingfossils on earth. These organisms are 3.5 billion years old and could barely be perceived from the boardwalk that was erected to protect them from misguided humans.Matthew, Kris and I made the most of the open space and naturally occurring sandy sculptures thatexisted in and around the Stromatolite pools. We grabbed an extensive number of photos, in blue sky,crystal clear water surroundings.For all of us it was important to ensure we were covered from head to toe in sunscreen given theintensity of the sun. I took the sun protection stance maybe a bit too far at times, smothering my face inzinc, appearing like an English cricketer at the ashes. We saw amazing sights on the travel south.Francois Peron National Park offered special views of jelly fish plumes. There must have been thousandsof the commonly known “Blue Bottles” or “Man O’ War” that stretched the length of the bay. We sawmany animal related sign posts along the way too. The most elusive of which was the Bilby. Anyway, ifthere was one, we were pre-warned.Life Turned Upside Down145 of 156One of the most memorable and plush areas we visited on our travels was Monkey Mia. Most places wehad visited up until that point were destitute and remote. Monkey Mia claimed itself as an outrightresort. It had a huge car park, check in, a shop, a huge beach and extensive eating areas.I managed to set my tent up on well-groomed green-green grasses located next to the camper vanparking. I felt spoilt. Palm trees swayed next to the board walk that led to its white sanded beach.Matthew and I couldn’t get our board shorts, sun cream, rash vest, snorkelling gear on any quicker.When we got into the shallow waters of the bay I felt anxious as my foot glanced a ray that rested onthe sea bed. Immediately I reverted to swimming in its shallows. There wasn’t a great deal to experiencethere, there was so much sea grass that the view of the sea floor was obscured. At least the water waswarm, given its depth, which made the experience more similar to bathing than to swimming.Monkey Mia offered breath-taking views of its bays. Kris, Matthew and I lapped it up as we sat outsidein 20+ degree temperatures sipping on beers we bought from the shop. We decided to make the mostof the takeaway food options; as good as our prepared food was, a takeaway offered a welcome changeand little in terms of washing up.The next morning instead of the usual “pack up and hit the highway”, we went to the beach for anresort organised spectacle. Each morning a Monkey Mia staff member appeared on the shoreline neartheir offices with a bucket of gutted fish.The staff member that appeared this morning had a microphone and explained what we were about tosee. It was obvious from the dorsal fins of the animals swarming ever closer to the shore that theseanimals were bottlenose dolphins. The staff member described who the individuals in the pod were andthe interlinked history of Monkey Mia and the dolphins. Simply put, without the dolphins there wouldbe no Monkey Mia, this is what the tourists came to see and had been for the past 30 years.Life Turned Upside Down146 of 156Once the gutted fish supplies had been exhausted it was time for us to hit the road. The next stop wouldbe Kalbarri National Park; along the way there were a wonderful selection of pristine coves, we had tostop and snorkel. We ended up arriving into Kalbarri on the night and was welcomed by a road sign thatspelt out the town’s contents, which was nothing to be sniffed at. It ticked all the boxes: a caravan park,a fish and chip shop and a liquor store.The next morning, we headed towards Geraldton. It was amazing how much industrial activity was goingon in the town. Add to that the number of multi-trailer trucks that we had to pass by on our way in andway out cemented the economic boon that it was experiencing. The multi-trailer trucks were filled tothe brim with excavated riches from the nearby mines. Overtaking them, as they were by far the slowestthing on the road, was an unnerving experience. Even though the highways were long, straight andwide, the trucks consumed them. They seemed to snake forwards, the robust hinges of the trailersworked hard to keep the behemoths from straying off the red dusted highways.My approach to overtaking was to use every last pony of the Mitsubishi’s moderate equestrian power toget past as soon as humanly possible. Preferably, if the road ahead was quiet and I could see a convoy ofthe trucks I was happy to approach at full kilter. Using the lorry to slip stream I could then propel theMitsubishi even quicker past. There could be many trucks in the convoy, which had to be accounted forin the overtaking manoeuvre for maximum effectiveness. I had little appetite for pulling in and I’m surethe truck drivers didn’t want to let up any power given the amount of energy required to propel themalong. Thankfully there weren’t any incidents as we gently followed the highway down to Nambung(after being told off numerous times by our backseat driver/sleeper Kris to not drive so fast).It was in Nambung that we saw Western Australia’s equivalent of Stonehenge, but on a much broaderand smaller scale. The “monoliths” that propelled out of the sand made for interesting, subjectiveviewing. “Look at that one, it looks like Rabbit ears” I declared. Most looked like giant petrified boggies.With so many of these human size abominations, it made for an absurd amount of funny photographicmoments. The aim being to try to appear to be the human element of the rock, much like theTerminator’s human skin was to the underlying exoskeleton. We had a long journey ahead as we Life Turned Upside Down147 of 156continued south, clocking up nearly 12 hours of drive time to safely and speedily reach our next stop,Margaret River.Margaret River is a huge place; it’s not enough to say you’ve seen it if you’ve just been into the town toshop around at its bohemian, organic stores, surf shops and trendy cafes. Margaret River has acres andacres of land filled with grapes and yes, fine wineries that use the fine fruit. As Matthew, Kris and Iperused the retail sector we were pleasantly, but not shockingly, surprised to see a tour-agents (DirtyDetours) offering many a cool trip. We took a closer look; we found a tour we all agreed would suit ourpallets and stretch our legs, the ‘Sip n Cycle - Winery Tour’.On paper the tour didn’t seem like the safest of expeditions, alcohol and exercise usually results innegative consequences. Having been in a sardine can on wheels for so long, the excuse to get on a bike(which especially suited our Dutch group member) was too difficult to turn down.We donned our silver helmets, sunnies & grabbed our mountain bikes. We waited outside the tour’sheadquarters while the group of equally enthusiastic participants gathered. Thankfully the pace of theriding was relaxed and the 18km of terrain was flat as French pancake.Having had some experience wine tasting on my travels over in New South Wales and South Australia Ihad a good idea what to expect. I did try my best to try and follow the guidance provided by the staff atthe wineries. I think I got away with trying to look sophisticated at our first stop. As we travelled on tosubsequent wineries the alcohol affected our guard a little, which meant for more ridiculously fun photoopportunities. Thankfully our bikes were taken away from us when we reached the 3rd and final winemaker.Life Turned Upside Down148 of 156The beverage sampling didn’t stop there at the tour’s end. Having found a beautiful country pub closeby to a large body of water serving a “bevvy” of locally brewed beer it was stupid not to sample eachone. Thankfully the Bootleg Brewery pub had just the setup for us; after the sweet taste of the wines,the taste buds were in for a surprise. With 8 sample beers, each housed in little more than a shot glass,it was time to work out which was best. This wasn’t as easy as it seemed; all beers were, as is traditionalin Australia, refreshingly fizzy. The depth of flavour of each beer swung from tart sourness to malt bodyness. Astonishingly, me being a drinker of darker beers, it was the lager that won both Matthew’s andmy heart.The magnificence of Margaret River cannot be fully realised unless you take a look at the Indian ocean.The sea powerfully heaved onto the shore while the sun beckoned from the heavens of the overcast sky.Any place that houses a lighthouse, the conditions are sure to get a little hairy. Where we were, thelighthouse prominently peering above the rocks. It was amazing seeing the sun set from our perch onthe rocks.The trip over to Pemberton was a trip into the forest of giants trees. The Gloucester Tree or Firemans –Lookout tree was tipified the immenseness of the branched beauties. To ascend to its nest there weresteel bars protruding from its trunk to allow the climber a chance to get up there. Thankfully, Matthew,Kris and I took the climb in our hesitant, cumbersome strides. The view from the top of The GloucesterTree, allowed us to see the Eucalypt canopy for as far as the eye can see. The view below of the forestfloor was equally impressive, but just a touch scarier.On returning to earth we sought a secluded place to have a taste of the fresh produce we hadpurchased. On finding a park bench it was like a scene from a Doctor Doolittle movie. ColourfulAustralian birds like the Ring-Necked Parakeet and the Western Rosella tamely waited by. Tucking intoany scraps of food that made its way onto the floor.Life Turned Upside Down149 of 156There were lots of walking paths throughout Pemberton; the forest of epic, monster trees was by far myfavourite.Our next stop on the trip was Dunsborough, a couple of hours door-to-door in the van. It is home to thebeautiful Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park and offers a range of excellent scuba diving options.Matthew and I, having completed our open water PADI certification (I had an Advanced certification, butI will not dwell on my superior scuba status given my lack of application i.e., experience) were interestedin one dive in particular, the Swan Wreck Charter SCUBA Dive.On one beautiful blue sky morning Matthew and I rocked up at the Cape Dive office, got onto theconnecting transport and turned up at the beach where the charming size Cape Dive speed boatawaited.Onboard I hadn’t a clue how to set up the scuba diving rig. It should have been as simple as ABC: Air,Buoyancy, Clips & Releases (the first two parts of the acronym, yes, the third part…). Thankfully the staffon board saw the error of my ways as I mistakenly put the airtank on the wrong way round. Ooo err.Having set up our breathing and buoyancy aides, it was all a matter of choosing a neoprene wet suit thatwas 2 sizes too big to complete the ensemble. I tried to look the part by wearing my metal Oakleysunglasses, an essential piece of water sports posers equipment. Matthew has his half-jacket plasticsunnies; for all tends and purposes they were more functional and better looking than mine. I refused tosay that to him though given the amount of pride I had in my sunglasses.Life Turned Upside Down150 of 156It may have been beautifully calm in the bay where we caught the boat. When we ventured out in todeeper waters the water got choppy. The poor vessel was hitting the waters hard as it speedily made itsway to our destination.There weren’t that many people on board the boat, essentially it was Matthew, me, 2 people fromSouth Korea and a married couple. I could sense the nervousness in the 2 South Korean tourists as theylooked precariously at the sea swell. When instructed by the Aussie guide “5 minutes till we enter thewater” we all readied ourselves and eventually jumped in.I opted for the missionary style lunge with arms by my side. The only issue with this entrance is whenthe face hits the water. The mask gets pushed into eye sockets with a jawing effect. Once in the water Ilaughed as I felt the immensity of the ocean swell toss everyone around like rag dolls. It was swell likenothing I had experienced before or since. I looked over at Matthew, my buddy, to see if he was okay.He indicated an okay sign, which was a relief. I looked over at the 2 Korean tourists; they flapped aroundlike a bunch of fresh kippers. They indicated to the staff they wanted to get back on board and dulybeelined for the boat as we, Matthew, me and the Aussie couple lay in the bowling waters.It was time to descend, which meant letter some air out of the BCD (Buoyancy Control Device). As perthe onboard briefing we dropped till we met a steel structure, which formed part of the ship. It wasteaming with an attachment of molluscs that swayed in beat with the ocean current. We stayed therefor a period of time to enable our bodies to adjust to the increase in pressure.We began to slowly follow the group leader as he led us to a depth of nearly 30 metres (my deepest diveyet). The water was surprisingly clear allowing us to admire the exterior of the ship as we made our wayto a rear entrance on one of the upper decks.Life Turned Upside Down151 of 156Matthew and I were side-by-side as we swam through what was once a hallway. The rooms located leftand right of us were devoid of windows and doors. As we peered through it was amazing to see thehuge numbers of fish congregating there.Matthew was flapping a bit more than me; I was having issues with buoyancy, as you do. As wedescended down the passageway to the lower floor Matthew’s fin fell off, much to his surprise.Thankfully my buddying skills allowed me to quickly retrieve it and we went on our merry way.Time seemed to slowdown as we moved through various compartments of the huge vessel. Before weknew it we were there amongst the molluscs at the top of the swan waiting for our bodies to completethe decompression stage.As we reached the surface we headed straight back to the boat for a well-deserved hot drink andbiscuits. After any dive I seem to get an appetite from consuming far too much salty water.We got back to safely to shore and on to the dive shop in Dunsborough. We enjoyed teas at theSamudra Ocean Cocktail Van before making our final journey to the capital of Western Australia, Perth.Life Turned Upside Down152 of 156On our travels the Mitsubishi Delica had never missed a beat (well it did, but only from a cold start andsomehow we managed to resuscitate it’s diesel heart). We entered Fremantle, on the outskirts of Perth,and headed to its centre to park up. All the time we had spent on our travels we had been quite isolatedand never cared for the state of our beloved vehicle. Now, in the hub of Fremantle town, covered in reddirt, windows splattered with flies, with its scarred graffiti clearly visible, we got some unwelcome looksfrom the residents. Of all the times on our travels, this was the time I cared for the Mitsubishi the most.It was almost a member of the family and I felt like it should be defended as such.Unfortunately, it had to defend itself as we left it to mooch around town. The Moreton Bay Fig treesreached their huge root systems out around Esplanade park. We walked over to Cicerello’s Landing andon through to Bathers Bay.Kris and Matthew were eagle-eyed, frequently checking their phones for any messages sent by their olduniversity friend. She was on her way from her flat in Freemantle to meet up with us for food and drinksat the Little Creatures brewery.When she did arrive the Aussie enthusiasm and keenness came through in droves. She beckoned us tofollow her to a place next door with an upstairs bar area. There we met up with her mates, beforegrabbing a lift to Leighton Beach located further up the coast.Leighton Beach hosted the annual Leighton Beach to Rottnest Island (so called by the Dutch after theirdiscovery of giant rats, or marsupial quokkas as they’re commonly known) kite surfing race. This, thebiggest kitesurfing race in the Southern Hemisphere was an amazing sight. 100s of participants couldbarely be seen as they sailed on top of the water in the distance. Initially only the chop of the televisinghelicopter engine could be heard and seen; after 10 minutes it was evident that there was somethingelse atop the waves as a line of white began to develop as the participants got closer to shore. Before Life Turned Upside Down153 of 156we knew it an amazing sight was in our midst; the kites decked the skies like rays of light filteringthrough the clouds.As the last of the participants reached the shores the kite surfers’ equipment was available to peek atbefore being packed away. The kites were immense; if one of these were to hit someone, that someonewould know about it from the comfort of a hospital bed.After sundown we went back to our Australian hostess’s accommodation. She had a humble flat not toofar from Fremantle centre. The flat had a bohemian vibe, like most bohemian abodes a guitar wasperched in the corner of the living space. Up until this point in the trip I had not caressed a 6-string sinceI left Sydney, and with it my acoustic. I picked her up placed her on my lap and began strumming. It wasout-of-tune; the one track I had in my mental playlist was Metallica’s “Nothing Else Matters”. This trackassisted me with ensuring the strings were close to playing at their correct pitch. It was sheer ecstasyplaying guitar again; I was in that moment called “flow” where time simply left me and onwards I playeduntil the call of nature forced me to take a break.As I entered the bathroom, I sensed something was not quite as it seemed. Why were there pottedplans and pots in the shower? Why was there an egg timer hanging on the wall? As I observed thisconundrum from the comfort of the throne an answer revealed itself. Perth was hot, hotter on averagethan even the mighty Sydney. Maybe all those items were there to make the most of the water. Jeez,even the UK, with its modest amounts of sunshine, has hosepipe bans.Matthew and Kris slept happily in the Australian hostess’s spare room while I grabbed the sofa. It wasnice to know that we near journey’s end, we just needed to make the most of the time we had over inthe capital.Life Turned Upside Down154 of 156The next morning we took the van back to the Wicked Campers rental service just around the corner.The garage was very much like the one we had visited over in Broome. A random grease monkey walkedover to us to claim the keys back off us. It was a slightly saddened moment walking away from theMitsubishi Delica. The van had been more than simply a means of getting from A->B, it was part of thememory of our trip.Another memory of the trip was my beard; I had begun growing it since the start of the trip, and now 3weeks later it was considerable. I went into the Australian hostess’s bathroom and looked in the mirror.As great a look as it was, I decided it should be relegated to the archives. Considerable effort wasinvolved in hacking the hair its perch on my face. As I shaved each section I stopped and observed what Ilooked like. What I really wanted to see was me with a moustache; my dad would be proud. As Icontinued cutting the hair from around the chin, I saw it. Me with a proper moustache was a compellingsight, one that surprised. It looked cool; I looked again in the mirror from a myriad of angles andpondered. Should I keep the moustache? I thought long and hard… Nope, as great as it was, I had toshow the top lip some daylight. With that I whipped off the remaining facial hair and hopped into theshower for a very quick, energy saving clean up.In the afternoon, Matthew, Kris, The Australian Hostess and her friends met up at Little CreaturesBrewery for lunch and a taste of Australia’s best brews. As we sat outside a nice warm breeze made itspresence known. It was great to feel the air on a clean-cut, smooth as a baby’s buttocks face.The day was a relaxation day, and with most days relaxing in Australia, for us anyway, a beer or manywas to be had. We migrated onwards to the beautiful Victorian pub in the centre of Fremantle namedthe Sail & Anchor before ending up watching the sun go down at Bathers Bay.Life Turned Upside Down155 of 156Good times unfortunately must come to an end. The morning of the Sunday the 13th December was thelong flight home to Sydney. Well, long in Australian terms; poor Kris and Matthew’s journey made minelook a mere hop compared to their lengthy journey back to the UK via Asia.Back in Sydney, my accommodation, as it had been for the past few months, was transient. I was nowliving over in work organised accommodation in a suburb named Homebush. It was a good train journeyto get over there.On the Monday I was back in the city, more descriptively I was now back in the K.J.Ross & Associatesoffice doing what is known in the consultancy industry as “bench” time (educating and upskilling inpreparation for my next gig). During the day I had a call with Mark, my manager whose thoughts aroundmy whereabouts had changed since we had spoken before the West Coast Australia trip. He wanted meto organise myself and move to Melbourne asap!The one boon of staying in Homebush was its proximity to Sydney Olympic Park (built to host theOlympic Games back in the year 2000). The ANZ stadium had hosted many musical gigs; I was privilegedenough to see Metallica play there while they were touring in Australia. On the Monday night I was toexperience the much loved and outspoken Irish rock band U2 on their 360 degrees tour. U2 really knewhow to put on a show. The central stage was tailored to their needs, featuring an array of colourful,synchronised lights. It was a night to remember; Jay-Z were special guests. He played a number of tracksthat suited a more rock audience; tracks that were a collaboration with Linkin Park were taken from hisback catalogue for all to appreciate.With it being silly (Christmas) season the whole of the week leading up to Christmas was made up ofopportunities to socialise and hit the body where it hurts, the liver. My expat mates had drinksorganised in NewTown; work had drinks organised in the Paddington for the Christmas party and therewere my leaving drinks to consider. All this was happening as I arranged to settle in a place to call homeover in Melbourne. I wondered if Lucinda’s flat as in Hawthorn was still available.Life Turned Upside Down156 of 156The countdown to my departure was nearing. On the Saturday morning I met up with my good friendlikDan Allam for a snorkel over at Coogee beach. The afternoon was spent socialising with Carl, Uma andtheir entourage over in a suburb named Rozelle. More and more social drinking was to be had with theever-looming date of my departure on the morning of Thursday 22nd December. The stars alignedsomewhat, my items in storage were to be returned to my friend and colleague Teresa come the newyear. Thankfully Lucinda’s flat was ready for me to move into and a flight was available to get over toMelbourne in good time to settle in.Melbourne here we come!
