# Life Turned Upside Down

## Chapter 1

### Shocked and Ashamed

It was late in the workday in early September 2009. The test automation wasn’t going to automate itself. Getting to the bottom of what the hell was causing the automated tests to freeze often proved frustrating. Focus was required to remedy this 21st century issue.

My fixation on the screen was disturbed for a second; out the corner of my eye I could see a usually jubilant Wilson approach. His agitated expression concerned me; I’d never seen this side of my jovial South African colleague. I looked away briefly to find the head space to gather my thoughts. I tried to over-ride my gut feeling and assert my approachable manner. Unfortunately, Wilson looked in great pain; “Hi Wilson” I said, mimicking his expression. As Wilson’s gaze met mine, he said with in mournful voice “Phil is here to see you. You need to bring all your belongings.” Those words were like a powerful electric shock that ran through my body. My adrenaline began to surge; the mind was immediately occupied with a multitude of contradictory thoughts… ‘Phil, why should he be here? He never appears without communicating his plans. Anyway, why isn’t he here in the office? Where downstairs is he?’ As I continued quickly, in step with a flustered looking Wilson, my thoughts began to wander. “It’ll be good to see Phil, I’m sure he’ll have some equally news; strange though, he’s never done spur of the moment.” Wilson and I continued our brisk walk outside, rounding the corner, and into the nearest available meeting room of the main office building.

The room was well lit and airy for such a small space. My attention was immediately grabbed by my boss’s suited and booted presence on the other side of small table. “Please take a seat Dave” he said in his soft, droll, East Midlands tone. His face showed concern, a seriousness that I had experienced once before, which resulted in a warning. He got to the point, “Dave, the laptop that you sent back to the office for repair was found to have explicit material on it. Our facilities management team have erased the material and all other media. Thankfully the sensitive material was not of an explicit nature, else we would have had to involve the police.” He continued, “Did anyone else have access to your laptop other than you?” “No, just me.” I replied. “I can only say that I’m disappointed in you Dave. You have two options: refute the claims and face dismissal after a trial, or two, voluntarily leave.” It dawned on me at that moment the weight of the circumstance.

The proverbial rug was being pulled beneath my 9-year career, working for the UK’s largest software testing consultancy. The house… The mortgage... What are my family and friends going to say? I began to feel rage, choosing to blame others for my misfortune other than myself. Firstly, Facilities Management, “Those f*cking b*stards, why the f*ck did they choose to target me?” Secondly, HR, “The reason Phil is here is because you f*ckers put your foot down and demanded that David Clarke should be forced to leave. Those London f*ckers have got it in for me.” I lastly blamed Phil for being the vessel with which this sh*t news logistically found its way to me. The rage subsided; the weight of the situation began to slowly sink in “What would you do Phil if you were in my position?”. “Write a letter of resignation here and now. You don’t want to drag this out.” Phil replied calmly. He got a piece of paper, a pen, handed them to me and dictated what I needed to write. I scribbled quickly, signing and dating the form before placing it on the small table. I felt calmer, I stood up and shook his hand “Phil, you’re the best Manager I have had the pleasure to work with.” He asked “Dave, would you willing to put that in writing?” I smiled, looked at him with a feeling of carefreeness. “No Phil.”

We exited the small inquisition room and made our way to the foyer where Wilson awaited. He still appeared flustered; all my personal belongings were strewn on the floor. He looked humbly at me; I returned a glance, indicating goodbye and hopefully I’ll see you again. I hurriedly tried to collect my items and exit the building with Phil at my side. Phil asked, “where are you heading?” I took my phone out my pocket, looked at the time and felt somewhat relieved I was finishing early. That thought invoked my short- term schedule for the evening. The plan was to play indoor football then head back to my home in Lichfield. I hesitated and indicated to Phil I was heading towards Aston University. He confirmed that he was heading towards the station, which was in the same general direction for the next few metres.

I began feeling my brain disconnect from reality and enter an empty space devoid of feeling. The small talk that Phil cast my way was met with a limp, lifeless response. I was still going to take part in the scheduled indoor football game, I could not let my friends down. I relayed that information at least. Phil shook my hand, wished me a hearty “all the best” before slowly disappearing down the street. I was left floating in an empty mind-set as I continued my walk towards Aston University.

At the leisure centre I saw my friends and tried my best to slow down my body movements to indicate I was experiencing a level of discomfort. When the football match started, I was on the pitch with 9others, at the same time I wasn’t. The feeling of shock was still present and wasn’t showing any signs of abating. My best friend Matthew Smith was on my team; when there was a break in the game, I desperately reached out to him. “Smiffy”, I took a deep breath, “… I lost my job today”. He gave me an expected quizzical look, his focus caught between the game and my outlandish statement, “what, er, why?” “I had explicit material on my laptop, nothing incriminating, just soft porn…” I said. The break in play ended; Matthew’s focus immediately shifted to the football.

The game finished; I didn’t care for the score. We showered, changed and started to go our separate ways. I thought about my next steps. What should I do now? I immediately thought of my support network. I wanted comfort, home; home being with mom and dad in the house I grew up in. My other best mate Doug, who played on the opposing side, lived close to my folks. As he said his goodbyes, I immediately hollered at him “wait, I’ll head out with you.” Slightly bemused he waited; as we approached the nearest bus stop; I built up the courage to explain my poor football performance. “Doug, I was laid off today.” He gave me a surprised look and paused, prompting me to explain further. I took a deep breath and hesitantly explained; Doug was one of the most supportive people I knew. He rarely said a negative word, offering a positive window with which to view the situation while we travelled. As the bus approached our stop Doug said, “if you need any help mate, just give me a call.” I thanked him for being there, for being a notice board for me to pin my worries on. It helped me rehearse for, what I subsequently realised, was going to be the most challenging situation I was going to face, relaying what the day's events to my parents.

The suburb streets were dark, which in many respects should have helped focus my thoughts. The feeling of nervousness and tiredness clinched the focus from my grasp. I reached the front door of my parents’ house and opened it slowly with the spare house key provided to me. I walked into the lounge to my dad’s welcome surprise. He said hello and asked how work had been. I felt flustered; the adrenaline began to course through my system, before I give a sheepish, general reply. “Yeah, okay”. I sat down. I looked over at my father and, with hesitation, began to elaborate on a general reply. “Dad...”, my jaw began to quiver uncontrollably, “I’ve been…”, I clenched my jaw shut as tears formed in the corners of my eyes, “laid off.” I tried hard to hold back the tears as I clearly saw my dad taken aback. As he slowly reeled from the news, I continued. “My work laptop, they found porn on there.” “Nothing explicit, standard stuff.” I could sense he was concerned, but not angry or upset by this news. His reaction was calm and reassuring. He began to do what fatherly figures should do; he offered his support.

Mom appeared from the kitchen and sat down, clearly surprised to see me. I relayed to her what I said to dad. She was seemingly shocked and showed her concern. She offered reassurance in her quick-fired Irish accented manner. “Don’t worry David, you’ll live forever on a paradise earth. You just need to follow Jehovah.” Good old mom, she just wasn't herself unless she relayed blurb from the Watchtower magazines. “You can stay here for as long as you like.” I felt the stress burn away like sunshine at dawn piercing the morning fog. I watched telly with Dad that night while mom spent time seeing to chores (an aspect of life for women of her generation). Slowly I felt calmer, Dad laid-back manner de-stressed menu end. The Friday night TV shows were entertaining too, which was nice. As the night progressed tiredness took the better of me. My mind, full of contrasting thoughts, slowly eased as my head melted into the lumpy pillow of my old bed.

The next morning, I woke up suddenly, clear of thought. I was… normal… stress free… happy… I could hear the radio blasting away with songs originating from my mother’s era. She sang a high-volume falsetto, overpowering the radio track. A smile slowly formed across my face; I felt hungry, a sensation I had not felt since lunch time of the previous day. I flung the bed covers to one side and made my way down the creaky carpeted stairs. My mother was always concerned about my stomach I.e., being fed well. In her quick-paced tone she said, “Now then what would you be liking?”, offering the contents of the fridge in a fried format. A smile appeared from the corners of my face as I exclaimed “I would love a toasted bacon sandwich with grilled tomatoes and HP sauce, my dwarling.” (“Dwarling” was one of those nicknames that I assigned to mom for reasons unknown. I found most of my inspiration for life was somewhat influenced by Monty Python’s Flying Circus and I’m sure that name, or something similar sounding, would have been deep in the recess of my subconscious and assigned to my mother on a whim.) I was a picky sod, even so at 30, but still less so than the pickiest eater of all, my dad or Fussy Fred.

The smell of the bacon cooking, cooked until burnt, as was the way with mom, filled the house. In her great waitress-like service, which I still didn’t appreciate and thank her for, she brought the bacon and baked bean toasted sandwich into the lounge and plonked down on my lap. My stare temporarily diverted from the TV to the plate, allowing me to locate the first crusty half with my right hand. Eating the toasted sandwich took my taste buds to a godly landscape where angels plunked on harps. It made sense why I never had a need to dabble with drugs; I just needed mom’s bacon and baked bean toasted sandwich to get me a high.

I showered and changed into my old casual wear that I handed-me down to my dad. I place my tainted work clothes into an old backpack of mine. My thoughts were to ready myself for the journey to Lichfield; Dad was up and asked if I needed a lift. He was heading to his brothers for a catch up and could drop me over at Marston Green Train Station. Or I could join him at Uncle Dave’s. I happily chose the latter; I really enjoyed a visit to “Uncle D’s”.

Uncle D, aka Uncle David, aka David William Clarke, was hands down my favourite Uncle. The man was intelligent, tall, laid-back; He never took life too seriously. He was well versed in all corners of life, but especially that associated with the Midlands car industry. Dave had seen the rise of Leyland and the fall of Rover. He ended his career at Land Rover aged 55; a retirement age that was unheard of for a blue-collar worker in Birmingham. In his lengthy career, from an apprentice to senior specialist in gearboxes, he had worked for one company that had changed hands and names multiple times. During the latter stage of his working life he would often bring round prototypes of vehicles to my Parent’s house. My fondest memory of such vehicles was the V8 GTB: a ferocious, old fashioned 2-seater sports car. It was a cacophony of muscular automobile audio and it didn’t half shift.

Dave’s wife Jane answered the door when we arrived. In her feminine, joyful tone she invited us to take a seat in the comfort of the lounge. Dave was sat, as he always was, on the sofa seat in the corner of the room. It was the perfect place to appreciate the large, widescreen telly. In his soft, approachable tone he asked, as he always had, “how are you? How’s work Dave?” Having already relayed my work predicament to several people I was well versed and comfortable to deliver it to Dave. He responded with, unsurprisingly, words of comfort and support. The conversation continued and devolved into factory talk, as it always did. The technicalities of the conversation were well beyond the realm of the average car lover; it moved to a conversation that only engineers could really appreciate. I remember the conversations of the past between my Dad and his brother, Uncle David; it had expanded my knowledge of the automotive industry and the biology of the motor car.

Aunty Jane was a great host, offering my Dad and I a wide choice of drinks: Tea, flavoured sparkling water, Coffee or Cordial. Flavoured fizzy water came on the new wave of refreshment alternatives. It sparked our interest, given it was sugar free, a boon for my diabetic dad. It was a beautiful drink, sparkling water with a hint of lime hit places most other drinks could not.

As Jane finished talking about her family a natural pause in the conversation appeared. It was a great moment for me and dad to say our goodbyes. We waved goodbye as we walked down the path that partitioned Dave and Jane’s from their neighbour’s. Sitting in Dad’s Toyota Avensis was a relief; the seats were some of the comfiest I have experienced before or since. The comfy drive to Marston Green train station, a stone’s throw from Uncle D’s, was an unwelcome sight. It felt like the first day at school, leaving the comfort of my parent and entering the unknown of the near future. I purchased a ticket and made my way to the platform. With my mind undistracted it was left to wander. This was a dangerous time; thoughts about my current situation soon set in. What the hell am I going to do?

The train weaved its way through Birmingham International, New Street and onwards north to my destination, Lichfield City station. I remember on many a “big” sociable Friday night in Birmingham City Centre catching the last train to Lichfield. The train journey was a good excuse to snooze; That was dangerous, missing the Lichfield City stop meant a journey onwards to Lichfield Trent Valley. You would think that the two stops, both being named after the 3-spired Cathedral city was easy to navigate between. This was far from the truth, with over a mile and a half of intersecting housing estate to navigate, it was 30 minutes from home. Thankfully on this journey my mind was far too occupied to attempt a slither of shut eye.

I opened the door to number 26: my vacant, quiet, 2 story townhouse. I took my shoes off and placed them in the vacant spot on the shoe rack near the Wi-Fi router. I hung my head and slowly walked into the cold lounge. I sat on the fat, tanned, leather recliner, electrically adjusting the recline to almost horizontal. I reached for my personal laptop. “booted it up”, “fired up” an internet browser and went to my first area of solace, my personal email. There I crafted an email to explain my current predicament and began adding friends, family and colleagues to the bcc field. _Send_ I sighed as I looked up and out to the view of my poorly maintained back garden. Thoughts of “how will this news be received…?” “Am I reaching out to the right people?” I wanted so badly to right the wrongs. I wanted so badly to have my job back. I felt so desperate, like everything in my current sphere of existence was only possible because of my job. “My material possessions cannot survive without an income stream” I thought. Without money coming in I felt the next step was to tighten the purse. I needed to reduce my outgoings. Where to start? The TV? The car? What about the house! I must do something about the house!!

It was late 2009, the housing bubble had burst in the midlands around July of 2007. The effects of that were coursing their way throughout the UK; terms such as “economic-crisis”, “economic-downturn”, “recession” was on everyone’s lips. No one had money and the ones who did weren’t going to spend it while dispossession after dispossession of property occurred. How did this affect me? I had originally bought my house for a cool £170,000 and owed over £150,000 to Alliance and Leicester. It was now worth less than £140,000. If I sold now I’d have to find £10,000 from somewhere to make up the difference owed. Was it even possible to sell the property as the current housing market stood? What was the rental market like? I knew nothing about the ins and outs of that world. There was only one way to find out, speak to the estate agents and get a slightly skewed feel for the consumers appetite.

The next day I composed myself and hesitantly through the back end of the estate to make my way to the retail bonanza of Bore Street in Lichfield City. Thankfully all the estate agents were rubbing shoulders with one another at the near end of the street. It was going to be a "postman” style exercise, but instead of delivering post, I’d be delivering simple housing market questions.

I began the window-shopping session in a formal order:

1. Tydemans
2. Jaymans
3. Bill Tandys
4. Hunters
5. Chattings

Having popped in and spoken to a member of staff in each place, by the time I got to the bottom Bore street I was well versed in my expectations. Yep, rental was going to be the way forward.

Chattings and Bergason Estate Agents signalled their interest but would need to see the property first before any contract negotiations could proceed. With my desperation clear the whole process to kick-off now. The sooner the burden of paying the mortgage on the property could be alleviated, the less stress my small shoulders would burden. Unfortunately, the feeling of immediacy was not reciprocated in the minds of the estate agents. It was more a “we’ll put an entry in the diary to visit you next week.” What, apart from thumb twiddling, was I going to do between now and then?

Chatting, i.e., speaking to not the estate agents, to my community was the best way I saw fit to spend my time. With the maturing of the internet, especially social media sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn, it was easy to stay in touch with the ones that counted, my loved ones and colleagues. All it took was a message, “I need your help!” Comfort to me, at the time, was more appreciated coming from my old colleagues in the form of prospective job leads and CV pointers. I tried the whole independent search for work via agencies and job websites. Being the one desperately in need of a job I felt in a terrible bargaining position. Every call arriving on my mobile phone made my adrenaline rush; I so wanted every call to be “Dave, we found you the ideal job. It’s in your field of expertise, a stone’s throw from where you live, offering £40k+ and you start tomorrow!” I basically wanted my old job back; I yearned to still be there on the client’s site, working with amazing people and doing a job I knew like the back of my hand. What a pillock I was! I had it all and I let it slip away… I had low self-esteem and lacked respect for myself at that time.

What was left on the jobs front during “The time of turmoil”? In a word, nothing. Jeez, desperation even led to me enquiring about getting my old job back. Funnily enough SQS-UK were in no mood to offer me that olive branch. I appreciated the kind words of assistance from old colleagues, it kept me in a positive state of mind knowing that I had support. Overall, though there was nothing that could be even a glimmer of an opportunity.

My thoughts would soon change when, one morning when I booted up my parent’s desktop PC and fired up a web browser at LinkedIn, a message in an internet bottle washed ashore. It came all the way from Australia, from a person who introduced me to big world of the IT industry, Mark Pearce. “Looking for UK test consultants he knows who may want to be sponsored into fulltime employment in Australia.”, the public board message read. I looked at this advert initially in a dismissive manner. I thought ‘, yeah, would be nice to travel to Australia, but to live and work there…?’

As the days went by and my appetite for anything work related grew larger, Mark’s LinkedIn advert was something I couldn't help but keep on returning to. The more times I did, the more I would try to sell the idea, which seemed ridiculous at first, but plausible and exciting the more open to the idea I became. The question was “Why not?” Subsequent calls to my network of colleagues confirmed that they were happy to assist me, but I should give Mark’s job advert consideration. That’s exactly what I did, setting aside the stubbornness and inner fears, I considered the words of my friends/ex-colleagues. That morning I changed-up my usual routine writing an email straight off the bat to Mark Pearce,

> Hello Mark,
>
> I have now left SQS and am now seeking work opportunities. Do you have any further information wrt "looking for UK test consultants he knows who may want to be sponsored into fulltime employment in Australia"?
>
> Thanks,
>
> David Clarke

My heart raced as I clicked the “Send” button. While the idea of living and working in Australia was stewing in my subconscious as the day progressed, my personal life was nearly ready to serve.

Chattings, the estate agents, agreed to become the acting landlords of my Lichfield property. They quickly found tenants: A middle age couple, he worked in the Midlands, she worked in Manchester. My Lichfield home would be there residential middle ground. They owned a dog; was I happy with the idea of a dog running around my fine fettled house? I began to warm to that idea, having briefly spoken to the lady when she viewed my house the one day. She was a lovely person; The way my brain worked, anything associated with her was going to be in the same light. I was happy in the knowledge that Chattings would ensure the tenant leave the property in a respectable state on their departure. The letting agent phoned to inform the couple (and pet) could move in, in the next couple of weeks. It was at that moment I began to feel the burden of my financial responsibilities slowly loosen its vice-like grip.

I excitedly returned to my emails that evening to see a reply with relation to the Australia job from Mark.

> “Dave,
>
> What happened ? I thought you were a lifer. As you may be aware I am now working for a Test Consultancy in Australia. I am always looking to bolster my ranks of good consultants, especially with people who I know and trust. My new company is registered to take on people via the 457-visa program.
>
> I have openings in Brisbane and Sydney at present. The company is very much in the mould of early days at Cresta. I have attached a guide to salaries, so you have an idea of what is generally on offer. Let me know if you want to take it further.”

As the days went by, so the email chain about the prospective new role grew. Prospects were splendid from home rental perspective too, the couple wanted to move in within the next week. Unfortunately, it didn’t leave me with a great deal of time to move out (given all the property’s furniture needed to be vacated in its unfurnished offering). I had to think up a plan to complete the demonstrative task. I had a few ideas, eBay being only one of them. Talking to my logically minded father it was better if I involved my family in the initial house-wares sale. A spreadsheet of all items for sale were listed, categorised and sent (via email) to close friends and family. It was going to be first-come, first-serve, sale of the century! I left the price column blank, asking the prospective bidders to have their say on how much they would like to pay. Items from the list took their time finding an appropriate buyer. After much prompting, apart from a handful of items, everything found a home.

The tiresome task of transporting the items to their bidders was assisted with the use of a white Ford Transit van and my brother. An optimistic morning’s work took the whole day, effortfully completed nonetheless just as the sun began to set.

In many ways those weeks being out of work were a blessing in disguise. I moved in with my parents and got the opportunity to spend more time with the people I loved. My parents were retired, but still active day-to-day; my Mom was the local taxi for her elderly Jehovah’s Witnesses buddies. Every day the phone rang, in most cases the line of questioning by the caller was “is ya mam there?” In many cases I had to disappoint them, she was obviously out taxiing another “client”.

Dad was taking to retirement in a more relaxed fashion. His schedule was a mixture of DIY, cooking, fishing and meandering. The latter activity was a once-a-week joint adventure with my Uncle David. Uncle David loved sourcing new Midlands walking trails on the world wide web. He loved the www in general purely based on the obscene amount of knowledge it held. When it came to walking trails, the more obscure they were, the more excited Dave got about trying them. He even went as far as sourcing blog sites that detailed unmapped walks in the Midlands. Given the time of year we often got muddy. Given the obscure source of the planned walks we often got lost too. Rest assured we always found a pub that was strategically positioned at the trail’s end.

Fishing with Dad and his mates was another not to be missed weekly outing. Wednesday was “go fishing” time over at Barston Lakes with Ken, Alan, Malcolm (Dad’s mates) and Dad. It was “catch and release”, bragging rights were given for catching the single heaviest fish and the heaviest bag of fish. Those honours were cemented with a pint at Stonebridge Island Pub after the last set of fishing tackle was packed away. Dad’s mates were old school, their views on life lacking the depth of today’s culturally sensitive individuals. They often talked about the past through rose tinted glasses. “Do you remember when…” was often said. Sledging was much a part of their culture as was the way the drinks rounds were organised. Back in their day (they all would have been 20 somethings in the 1960s) they wouldn’t have thought twice about getting drunk and driving home. At the pub, post fishing session, they stretched the drink/drive limit law. Let’s just say that I thankfully didn’t have to drive home, having drunk the same quantity as each member of the group.

## Chapter 2

### Time to Transition

One day, out with Dad and his fishing buddies at the Lakes, I was checking my email when I noticed something interesting. An email from Mark Pearce! I excitedly, but apprehensively clicked it. Up popped the mail in all its opportunistic glory. The contents spelled out interest in bringing me to his team in Sydney, Australia. He stated his willingness to sponsor my work visa application through the “457 scheme”. I was filled with trepidation. I didn’t understand the process, what was required of me and what the timelines were from job/visa application.

Mark got me in touch with the company HR department where the to-ing and fro-ing of communications continued. Sydney, Australia was 9 hours ahead of UK time. My conversations, mainly with HR, happened often during their lunch time, 3am GMT. I would often fall to sleep, trying to stay up till said unearthly hour. Being woken up and coherent at that time in the morning after a brief spell of deep sleep was as easy as getting fat. Thankfully the telephone line was clear as a bell; conversations managed to prove fruitful and amazingly after a period of only 4 weeks my electronic 457 visa came through.

It was late October 2009, nearly 2 months after my fateful meeting with Phil, I had been granted an Australian visa and successfully gained employment with an Australian software testing consultancy. Australia, a massive country located the other side of the world; a place I had only seen in films and soap operas. The dream of working again was now a reality. Still, through all the excitement there were deep, stomach-churning, “what the fuck am I doing”, doubts playing in my head.

To turn the news into more than just words in an email I announced it to my family, mates and colleagues. By announcing it that the news went from an idea to a plan. Surprisingly, everyone was supportive, but I could sense their disappointment. It was at that moment I appreciated the value I added to those who I surrounded myself with. Selfishly, I had to split those ties for the sake of work. Was work higher priority than my family and friends? The culture accepted it; work was one of life’s requirements. Why? Work was society’s back bone. Years in school and further education prepared us for it. It was part of our identity and in many ways defined who we are. I wanted my identity back; Australia was going to be the land to had it back to me.

One morning, back at my parents’, I fired up the family computer and navigated to the Emirates website. I entered potential flight dates, Birmingham International Airport to Sydney, Australia. I wanted to get a feel for how much this was going to cost me (this cost would come out of my pocket)!? Flights on the weekend were a lot more expensive than mid-week ones. With my bank somewhat depleted from a lack of wages for a couple of months, my mind was focused on getting the best bang for buck. Unfortunately, it would mean having to leave sooner than I’d hoped.

Without consulting a soul, I hesitantly went through the booking process. The prices that appeared weekday and weekend for one-way travel were not much different from one week to the next; so, the earlier mid-week, the better. I was step 5 of 6 in the booking process; I put much effort into ensuring the debit card details I entered were accurate. My heart raced as I clicked the submit button. The congratulatory confirmation page appeared, £800 had been ripped from the heart of my pitiful current account. That was it, no possibility of a refund, I was now a committed traveller to Australia, the other side of the bloody world. It was at that moment that the doubts dissolved and the headrush began. I hadn’t this much elation in my all my life. I was going to Australia! Wow! I best think of a detailed plan of attack. My mom popped into the dining room on her way to the kitchen. I stopped her in her tracks and, with a smile on my face, delivered the “good” news. “Mom, in 4 days-time (November 5th) I fly out of Birmingham Airport, en-route to Sydney.” She paused and looked at me; not with the beaming expression she usually gave, it was one I saw before, disappointment. It was difficult not to read the negativity in her body language. “Oh, good”, she continued walking into the kitchen. My elation began to deflate as I thought again about how this decision could affect my family. I couldn't help but feel selfish and question what ultimately I wanted from this experience.

- Work first and foremost
- Travel experiences secondly
- A kick up the arse thirdly.

‘I’ll give it 2 years and see how it goes’, I thought.. A thought I would later return to again and again. Life refused to slow between the time I booked the flight and the day I was to visit Birmingham International Airport. I felt organised, there was little left that required my physical presence in the UK. My house was to be inhabited by new tenants. My household goods were all but sold to close family and friends. Flights booked, bags packed, accommodation organised by Mark and his cronies. I did my best to ensure I was going to hit Australia running. My soon to be boss Mark advised I should head to my local HSBC to setup an Aussie bank account; that would save me some time before heading over. One of the outstanding tasks from Mark’s Company’s HR department was details of a current account. Unfortunately, it wasn't straightforward as Mark had pictured. Having secured an appointment with an HSBC advisor, the advice given was “it’s far easier to set up a bank account when I was over in Sydney”. With that, after food, water and shelter I prioritised the task of opening a bank account when I reached Sydney CBD. My next and most immediate task was packing, packing for a new life. How do you pack for a new life? I could only reflect on trips I had embarked on recently. The thinking process around those excursions was to throw in flip-flops, shorts and a pair of speedos. I knew according to the weather forecast for Sydney that it was going to be a hot one, so I wouldn’t have to bring my woollens, but I needed to wear something to shield me from the conditions here before flying out. I rummaged around my parents to see what I could find; I had completely forgotten about my snorkelling wears. What better an opportunity to use them, but they were bulky. The fins alone just about fit into my large Samsonite suitcase, which did a fine effort swallowing most of my wears. Some of the “overspill” would be make its way into my small backpack. Unfortunately, some items would have to stay in the UK. There was a hope that a point soon I would return and claim the remainder. The day came; I had planned as well as I could have. It was now time to catch the first leg of the flight from Birmingham International Airport to Dubai. Mom and dad were, just like concerned parents should be, happy to see to it I was there to check in to my flight at least 3 hours before it departed. It was nice to be chauffeured in the family Toyota Avensis, “the princess” as I called it. The car was parked in the short stay, a mere one-minute walk from the airport’s main entrance. Emirates, the flight operator, had nearly half of the departure lounge dedicated to their operations. Money = power, as they say. So, there I was, waiting in the queue to check in, passport and flight ticket in hand, dressed in T-shirt and jeans. Mom and dad did a fine job making me anxious by asking round of embarrassing, interrogative questions e.g., “did you pack your verruca cream? You know your skin flares up when you don’t…”. It was a relief to be called up to the check-in counter. I handed over my passport and was asked to lift my luggage onto the conveyor/scales. As the numbers on the LCD began to increment, I began to stress. I was dumbfounded why my luggage was so heavy. Maybe my parents had thrown in the kitchen sink while I was occupied!? Well, something had to be taken out to drop its weight below the allowance. I pulled the luggage to one side. With my parents’ assistance, we began shifting some of weight. The question was, what was I going to remove and what was I going to do with it? I frantically began taking out some of the outer wears with my parent’s assistance. I did what was akin to an episode of Friends when Joey wore all of Chandlers clothing in one effort. Wearing the larger outer clothing allowed me to focus on the smaller items of luggage. All of those were then painstakingly condensed and squeezed into my onboard luggage, which would add to my weight while onboard. What a palaver! After packing reorganisation shenanigans, my brow and additionally clothed body was laden with sweat. Not a good look, not particularly comfortable either; additional outer layers were trapping the heat and regulating my elevated temperature. I sighed, first world issues; better to have brought too much than too little. After a successful second attempt to check in, Mom, dad and I made our way upstairs to the departure lounge entrance. I fell silent and looked at my parents. Mom added a cursory statement “well that’s it now” as the escalator reached the top. I saw the cordoned off area where a small number of passengers were queueing. I slowly turned to face my parents: I hugged my mom and kissed her. Dad was not a “touchy feel-y” person, which made me hesitant about how I should greet him farewell. I knew the handshake was acceptable in all my social circles; I reached for his hand. In the moment after our handshake disconnected, I felt compelled to hug him. He slowly reciprocated; it was a short moment that felt like it lasted an eternity. As I loosened my embrace, I turned to face the departure lounge, walked a few steps, and waved back to my parents. I could clearly see tears in my dad’s eyes. I had to bite my lip to stop myself from crying. I continued to wave and onwards I ventured to the security gate. Birmingham International Airport was once my part-time place of work; a supplementary income for my6th form education in the late 90s. Back then I worked at the UK retail giant WHSmith. Back in my day they had shops in all areas of the airport: check-in, landside (pre-departures) & airside (departure lounge). I finished after 4 years’ service; I was told on leaving that I was close to being promoted to supervisor. I’m sure that would have been an interesting chapter in my life, but possibly would have derailed the Australia life opportunity that lay ahead. The number of WHSmith stores in the airport were less than I anticipated. It looked like there was another newsagent that had taken tender turf. How did that happen? On who’s watch? In the departure lounge I took whistle-stop tour of the shops starting with the duty-free, the fleeting focal point of any airport departure lounge. The duty-free section never failed to amaze; “how can so many fragrances coexist in the same market?”, I uttered to myself. I tried not to look at the staff, a sure sign of interest; I applied a look of textbook disinterest and trundled on. It had been well over 8 years since I last worked at WHSmith. There was a hope that when I moseyed on into the store, I would be surrounded with adulating workers. In such a transient environment were any I had the pleasure, and in some cases the agony, of working with still working there? I looked towards the check-outs to gawp at the staff. Who were these strangers? Where was the magazine stacker Matthew Eton, the confectionary expert Anthony Bailey or the big boss lady Kim? More importantly, where was the “Dave’s WHSmith Work Home Coming” celebrations? ‘Ah shit!’ I thought before heading over to the car magazine section, sighing and flicking through the automotive news. Even though I wasn’t a car enthusiast, I admired them. They were relatable things that my family appreciated. As I skimmed the final pages of Car magazine, I looked up at the departure information screen. The gate for Emirates flight to Sydney, Australia, via Dubai, was opening. Which gate? Yep, found it. It was now a matter of leaving the comfort of the departure lounge and walking down a tunnel to the arse end of the airport. I could see the queue for the Emirates gate from a comfortable distance away. It was a good 50 people deep already, with plenty of folk still confined to the jail-like gate seating area. As I walked to the end of the queue, I took a good look at my soon to be flight neighbours. What I wasn’t expecting was to see anyone recognisable. ‘Was that?’ my brain wasn’t firing on all cylinders. It took a while to put the faces to names, in this case a popular Birmingham rock band. Bloody hell, it’s Moseley’s finest, Ocean Colour Scene. A “back in the day” band that signalled memories of drinking unhealthy amounts of alcohol, hitting the dance floor & positioning traffic cones on monuments. Good times? Questionable, but the tunes that accompanied those days in the late 90s were bloody awesome. Maybe this journey would be special, given Ocean Colour Scene’s presence. As I waited patiently in the queue I peered out through the huge, bright departure gate windows. I knew the plane was going to be big, given the distance it was to travel, but nothing prepared me for the scale of the Emirates A380. It was the big foot monster truck of aircraft with an upper and a lower deck. It had to be special, given the length of time I was going to be using it for; Anything less than monster just wouldn’t cut the mustard. After my boarding pass and passport were checked I saw the passenger tunnel(s) to the A380’sentrances. An endless labyrinth with signs indicating seat numbers and class levels. I made a conservative guess, finding another queue. As I made it to the doorway to the entrance I stepped through, greeted by humble, female staff wearing a sari, red cap and a brown business suit. Being a parochial Brummie lad, the elegant, foreign, yet smart attire of the crew caused me to ogle. Thankfully, after a flick of the head I regained my composure. I showed my boarding pass, which usually resulted in a nod of the air host/hostess’s head. This time around I was given runway style directions, given the multiple isles of seating. I walked past the space-age capsule seats of first and business class entered standard class. This wasn’t no ordinary standard class; it was HUGE and more importantly it was EMPTY! I had at my disposal a bank of 4 seats all to myself. If only I had a mattress, I thought. I sat down; I felt an immense sense of joy from taking off multiple outer layers. My skin could breathe again; my body felt unshackled. I stretched my neck and lay my eyes on the back of a seat headrest in front of me. What was this? I had experienced in-flight entertainment before, but this, this was something taken from the future. What faced me enveloped my periphery. Is that a “wide” screen!? I excitedly reached for the controller that formed part of the console beneath the “viewing platform”. This controller, much like a coin, had two sides. One was a straightforward interpretation of the couch potato’s TV controller. The other side of the remote made me reminisce of the golden era of home console gaming. What entertainment possibilities lay ahead? What have they not packed into this? In the meantime, while the default, unchangeable flight path screen was visible, I just had to wait. It was a time to get comfortable and aware of my surroundings, especially the location of the bathrooms and staff cubicle areas. Dubai was a good 8-hour journey ahead. I wanted it to be stress free, with as much entertainment time that my brain could possibly process. One thing I love about long haul flights, apart from the video entertainment, is the free-ness of everything. Space maybe tight by the standards we are used to in everyday life, but by aircraft standards this plane’s cabin room was more than ample. What was more awesome was the available elbow space. The row of 4 seats, had no other passengers assigned to them. This made me think about the possible sleeping configurations that figuratively lay before me. Firstly though, to “stop the dogs barking” I had to take off my shoes. I noticed that Emirates had supplied a nice little bag of onboard night-time comforts: toothpaste, blind fold, slippers and bed socks. In my whole 30 years on this planet I had not tried bed socks, now was the time. Of all life’s experiences I wouldn’t say I was blown away by the generic, one size fits all, bed sock wearing experience. At least it made me appreciate the socks I took off, which did fit me. Now, to find the nearest toilets. I was blessed, if you’re of a positive disposition, with a very weak bladder. It had dogged me all my life. Knowing where the toilets were in any establishment was a “must know” requirement. With the few people on board, the large number of toilet cubicles and no one obstructing my passage to the porcelain shrine I was as happy as a thirsty racehorse. I was “buckled up” and ready to go. After a surge from the mighty Rolls-Royce jet engines, a climb to cruising altitude and with seat belt signs turned off, I looked around me. People were staring at their in-flight entertainment systems like zombies watching a show about autopsies. I sat back down and “do as the Romans do”, absorbed. Films, Games, TV Episodes of great US and UK favourites filled my senses. While the joy of this 21st Century experience continued, the serving of meals (presented in accordance with a printed set menu), were served around the clock. I was even able to have additional menu items if I so wished, which I did, by asking the staff. This felt too good to be true; what was the catch? For a moment there I had forgot, I had spent the bad end of £1000 to experience this. This would be the all the impetus I required to eat every stone of that diamond cake I made. We arrived at Dubai Airport on their evening. I was tired, my body knew it was late in the UK night. I also knew that the layoff at Dubai Airport, while passengers waited for their connecting flight, would be many hours. I either needed bed, a beverage or a night club to try and kick my awareness into gear. As I reached the immense hanger that was the Dubai Airport Departure Lounge, I performed a recce of the airport. Shop, café, newsagents, duty free… I walked and walked; it was then I saw it. It reminded me of a shipping container, there was a restaurant on the first floor, but where were the stairs? They were out of view, but accessible. I thought it appropriate to look at said restaurant, so I climbed the stairs. What I didn’t realise as I got to the first floor was the huge bar, out of sight from the departure lounge thoroughfare. The bar had a selection of many worldly alcoholic beverages. Me, being partial to a pint of the black stuff placed a Guinness order. Immediately before pouring he announced the price. I did a double take, and hesitantly reached for my wallet. £5 for a pint back in 2009 was more than double the going rate at the local. It even made the night club prices pale in comparison. I closed my eyes and unwillingly handed the money over. The bar man asked me to take a seat. One of the other staff members then showed me to the lounged area behind the bar. I quizzically looked at the large lounge. I was handed a remote control. As I bemusedly looked at the device, the large widescreen TV that lay before me and sumptuous leather sofas, my pint arrived. It was perfectly chilled and accompanied by a selection of salted nuts. I smiled as I set my luggage down and melted into the seating. I pointed the controller at the TV, pressed the ON button and absorbed the hymn sheet of channels that cascaded down the screen. It was then I saw it, being a big martial arts fan at the time, Ultimate Fighting Championship. I selected the Xtreme Sports Channel that housed the programme, placed the controller down, reached for a generous helping of nuts. As the crunchy nut fragments filled my mouth I reached for my pint. The cool, smooth, roasty tones of the Guinness complemented the snacking environment that lay before it. I lay there, content as a pig in pig shit. A smile beamed from my face like a lighthouse as I watched 2 martial arts experts beat ten bells of shit out of each other. The tiredness took its toll. As awesome as watching & relaxing in a living room in a pub was. what I really wanted was bed. I felt I had to keep awake, after watching the concluding moments of the main UFC event (it ended in Frank Shamrock causing his opponent to tap out) I made it back to the concourse for a wander. It wasn’t the most comfortable of walks lugging around an onboard suitcase, wearing winterwears in the temperature-controlled climate of the modern electronic feedback loop installed in the rafters. As I walked on, I saw what can only be described as the sun loungers: Long bed like leather covered seating shaped like its sun lounger cousin. The loungers I initially saw were taken, to my annoyance, but I wasn't shocked by this discovery. It’s all about supply and demand, on this occasion supply outstripped demand or so I was led to believe. I walked on, staggering more so than walking, my brain experiencing a dull fuzz that I couldn't shake. It was then, as what happens when you least expect it, when I saw them, free loungers. ! I looked to the heavens beyond the high ceiling and said a thank you. I’m not sure why I do that, I’m not religious, maybe subconsciously I want something supernatural to reply with the equivalent of a wink or a thumbs up. I literally leapt onto the bed like structure and tried to get comfy. After much faffing I got my contorted body into, what I thought was, the ideal sleeping position. The position was akin to the foetal position, with pike (I’m not sure what that means, but it sounds respectable in the pool diving circles). I closed my eyes and… I felt my heart racing, my adrenaline pumping. I was still so excited about the journey ahead that the slideshow of thoughts just wouldn’t stop. The body can be a cruel beast. The contradiction of excitement and tiredness… It reminded me of Christmas time as a school kid. Funny, looking back, Christmas Eve was the night I wanted to pass by the most. It ended up being the longest night of the year. My brothers and I would clock watch till the dials fell off. I again thought about moving from the makeshift nest of the lounger to… somewhere else… but where? I thought that maybe I could amplify the adrenaline rush with a dose of caffeine. The Costa Coffee shop was a welcoming, but quiet environment thanks to the time in the morning. Thankfully there was a fresh-faced barista operating the espresso machine. I sat with the piping hot, frothy coffee on the table. I slowly looked around at the vacant space that lay before me. With one hand clasping the saucer and the other triggering the coffee mug, I slowly consumed the contents of the hot beverage. The taste, texture and caffeine hit made for a brief euphoric experience. The short-lived hit was worth the money spent, but the intended state of mind that I was reaching for did not persist as I had hoped. What I really needed was intravenous, drip coffee. I was soon on the move again, but this time my body began to wake from its dullened state. As I walked, I looked out of the huge window that staged the airport runway. The sky, a maddening rea colour, was illuminated further by the rising sun. I stopped, sat down, keeping my gaze firmly at its powerful glow. It continued to rise and began to hurt the eyes. I looked away and then at my phone. Not long to go till I catch the connecting flight; the adrenaline kicked in again. After reading what appeared to be a every single car magazine in the airport’s newsagents, I waited in a large queue at the Emirates departure gate. Like orderly ants we followed our business, first and standard class routes. I was more than happy to be back in the environment I got so accustomed to hours earlier. Following my prior onboarding procedure, I walked to my seat, reached for the night socks and “re-engaged” the onboard entertainment unit. As I lifted the controller, I talked to the unit as one would converse to another human being, ‘Where did we get to?’.

## Chapter 3

### Heaven and a Half Pint

Another feature I love with regards to large passenger aircraft is how they land on airport runways; It is a buttery smooth experience. Barely a bump was felt as we touched down at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport. As we taxied to our arrival gate, I looked outside to see the sunshine and heat pulsate above the runway. I looked over at the main building and saw a sign that read “Welcome to Sydney”. There was a slight delay in the response from my head; it then hit me. I’m here, I’m in Sydney, I’m the other side of the world! I never thought I would be thinking that so soon in my lifetime. This euphoric distraction was a temporary reprieve from realising that my body and mind were zonked from all the travelling. The plane came to a smooth halt at the arrival gate. I gathered my cabin luggage and looked out the window; This was the place I was going to call home for the foreseeable future. I looked back at my plane seat/s. I would like to have said that a part of me died during that journey… and there it was, left on the plane ready to be cleaned up by the plane preparation staff. Au revoir dead skin cells! As I exited the plane into the fresh air, I winced. Jeez it was so bright here, like someone had peeled the protective layer off the sun. The humidity hit me straight away. The thought of being outdoors in warm bright conditions at the start of November left me confused. Welcome to the Southern Hemisphere I thought. It wasn’t going to be a thought that I could fully comprehend; another thought then consumed my mind as I walked to the security gate ‘have I done everything that needs to be done in order to gain entry to Australia?’ I looked down at my boarding card; it had a multitude of tick boxes relating to ‘Have you recently been to country…’ Thankfully, I hadn’t travelled much up until this point, as indicated by the glut of visas. I realised that my passport had nothing in it to indicate I could enter Australia. Sure, I had applied and successfully applied for a work visa, but where was evidence of this in my passport? I handed my passport and boarding card to the passport control officer who looked carefully at my documentation and then at me. The officer’s Aussie droll that enveloped the English language he used reaffirmed I wasn’t in some British outpost. He asked, “where’s your visa?” I hesitantly replied, “I have a457, working visa”. His confused gaze made me feel nervous. He passed my British passport to his colleague who took it to an electronic terminal behind him. I saw the passport being scanned and handed back to the first officer. The passport was opened to a fresh page; a stamp with an entry date was firmly applied. As the passport was passed back to me a huge sigh of relief emptied out of my body. My next goal, as I walked down the steps, was to wait for my luggage at the carousel. Luggage arrived drama free; as I walked through the “Declare or Nothing to Declare” embarkation zone into arrivals I noticed the Vodafone booth; ‘bloody hell’, I thought, ‘the unlucky sods they have Vodafone here too’. Funnily, Vodafone was one of the worst performing service providers in the UK. I wondered, with everything being down under and t’other way, was Vodafone the best mobile provider? I had a gander at their stand where I was immediately spoken to by an enthusiastic employee (well, all Aussies were enthusiastic by the British yardstick). I took some literature from the stand and trotted on. I looked up and saw a set of large public transport signs; I immediately followed the sign that indicated trains. I've always been a lover of the rail; this appreciation was heightened on a recent trip to Japan. I walked to the ticket booth to make an enquiry; I asked for a single ticket to the city. The train guard indicated I needed 2 tickets: a special ticket to enter the platform at the airport and one to exit when I reached the city centre. When the price of said tickets was stated I was taken aback. How much? Working on a rough exchange rate of 2 AU$ to the £, the cost was still north of £20. This was an unadulterated one-way, 20-minute journey into the city centre from the airport. Given this was the first item I had purchased in Sydney I thought this would set the precedence of all retail goods. ‘How was I going to financially survive?’ As I waited on the platform at the Sydney Airport Train Station the train arrived. It was like nothing I had seen before; a double decker train! On boarding, I took then lower deck given the weight of my luggage. As I sat down I soon realised how much space I was consuming and how difficult it was to keep the luggage close to hand. After managing to shepherd my wheeled suitcases I felt a little claimer. It was then when I noticed I was people watching. I was fascinated by the passengers on board; their fashion sense, spoken word & mannerisms were alien to me. The most shocking observation I made was the clothing the young teen girls were wearing. The denim shorts weren’t just short, a belt would be a better description. The shorts were wedged so far up their arse that from a foreigners’ perspective they looked like the buttocks had consumed them. A couple of “short-arses” sat in the seats in front of me and commenced chatting away. What hit me initially was the terse terminology the girls used. I was very much used to the way the more reserved English woman spoke. The “Aussie Gal” was blunt, to the point and willing to describe details in all their dirty glory. Aussie girls didn’t “beat about the bush” so to speak. I noticed that me, the observer, was the observed. The ladies prying eyes were set upon me from various sections of the train. I was wearing a black T-Shirt with an emblazoned, white cycling emblem across the front. My legs were covered in tight, dark blue jeans, set off by a pair of narrow, pointy, brown shoes. With my three, upper body focussed, training sessions a week physique, bulking up my clothing, I struck an impressive stature. My paranoia waned as out the corner of my eye I could sense the impending Sydney City Scape. The Skyscrapers towered just in front of the Circular Quay area, rising like futuristic shards out of a sci-fi movie. The only city I could compare like-for-like was Toronto, Canada. Both were new in colonial terms and both appeared extraordinarily concentrated. Sydney’s skyline was unmissable with its large Shangri-La and CN Tower buildings. The two other noticeable landmarks were the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House. The harbour at Circular Key, which encompassed the cityscape, was a hive of activity. Passenger boats were arriving and departing in a fascinating coordinated fashion. This was my stop according to the sheet of A4 paper containing the Google Map print out. The next part of my journey, according to sheet 1, was to get from Circular Quay to my accommodation. The HR department of the new place of work, consisting of one staff member, Leanne, booked the accommodation a good distance away from my new place of work. This apartment was out of the way, in no way central, which I’m sure would have cost the consultancy an “arm and a leg”. It made me think of my previous place of work, which was housed on the axiom of “as long as it’s cheap, it’ll do.” The accommodation was a 2-floor apartment block, good, located directly beneath a busy Aussie freeway, bad. I turned to sheet 3 of my print outs. Details of how to enter the apartment were present in all their glory. Thankfully the instructions were illustrated; I just needed to find the dull brown key safe and enter the number sequence 9876 (a secure number if ever there was one). On entering the number combination, the key store immediately sprung open, revealing a set of keys. It was like a moment from the legendary video game Zelda, the accompanying music played sinuously in my head. On opening the door to the apartment there was a lack of walls. The openness of the apartment environment was something I was not used to, having lived in a terraced house for a couple of years. It was interesting having the bedroom, lounge and kitchen in one large room; you could literally watch your eggs fry from the comfort of your own bed. I did love the natural light levels; it poured in through the windows on the one side of the apartment and diffused through the beige stained veiled curtains. I decided to take a closer look at the apartment's contents; each cupboard and drawer was opened to familiarise myself with their contents. The faster I acclimatised, the better; this abode I would be calling home for the next 2 weeks. There wasn’t much, or nothing particularly striking about the contents. You could say that my inquisitive needs were starved. I turned to my bag and began to rifle through the contents. Clothes, clothes and more clothes. Ah! I had located my electronic gadgets and other PC related goods. I had a gander at the back up CDs that I had “burnt”: Microsoft Office 2003, My Documents, Movies, TV Show Episodes, then I saw it, my porn collection. I loved soft porn; women with huge mammary glands stimulated my libido. I didn’t realise at the time that I had an unhealthy addiction to this material. The adrenaline rush prior and the orgasm that resulted post masturbation was a high that I couldn’t get enough of. The 2 days I had spent travelling to Sydney, 2 days without masturbating was probably the longest period in years where I had gone “cold turkey”. As I looked at the CDs of pornography, I felt anger; my reliance on it was the prime reason for me losing my job in the first place. Having travelled all this way, did I want to continue viewing this addictive material, frowned upon by the wider community? I took the CDs and, one-by-one, broke them into shards and poured the remnants into the bin. It was an empowering feeling, with a hint of regret. Like all addictions it was eating away at my conscious thoughts. Even though I had rid myself of the CDs, it didn’t stop me wanting it, needing it. Where did I draw the boundary? Was I to stop masturbating *full stop* or masturbate under certain, respectful, allowable conditions? Was the latter even an acceptable concept? As I attended to these thoughts, I began to accept masturbation as healthy under the condition it wasn’t stimulated by pornographic material. That conclusion gave me all the permission I seeked to continue this sinful behaviour. As I orgasmed and felt the temporary high that I seeked, I took a deep breath out and regained my focus. I still had a large list of jobs that needed completing. I changed into clothes more conducive to the Sydney summer and made my way to the bright beat of the street near the highway. It was lunch time; the streets of Sydney CBD were buzzing with workers hanging around St Martin’s Square and George Street. I did what every tourist does in an unfamiliar environment, I gawped at everything. The shopping arcade on George Street impressed upon me a feeling of British pride. Details of its colonial heritage were placarded in its Victorian architectural cues. As I exited and looked across the crossroads I was hit by a vision. “Is that… Woolworths!?” I said aloud. Woolworths had recently closed in the UK, but it appeared to be alive and well on the city streets of Sydney. As the pedestrian crossing indicated all was safe to proceed, I walked diagonally across the road and in through the entrance of “Woolies”. My initial observations were one of amazement. First and foremost, this shop was a supermarket, not a hodgepodge of discounted goods like its UK cousin. There were 3floors; the lower ground level extended its reach into the train station of Martin’s Square. I took a further look, initially observing the fresh fruit and veg section in detail. Bloody hell, the bananas were expensive. These mangoes are huge! What’s that? A watermelon!? I was like a kid in a sweet shop. I performed an assessment of each aisle, on each floor. As the minutes went by, my paranoia increased. I could feel the security system was eye-ing my every action. I did what any law-abiding citizen should do, perform an act of charity: buy the cheapest item in the shop before getting a move on. I still had several tasks that needed completing:

1. Open a bank account (this would help with getting paid)
2. Organise a mobile phone contract.

The sun was blazing on the high street. Where were all the banks? I know Mark Pearce had mentioned setting a HSBC account over in the U.K. Where was the main Sydney city branch? I hadn’t a clue which other banks were prevalent. I began to wonder about banking considerations. Which bank offered the best interest rates, the coolest websites, the most cashpoints. I was clueless and nervous; I knew once I had chosen a bank it would be a ball ache to change. I had to get it right, I had to be thorough. Why didn’t I do all the necessary research online prior to getting to Australia?! Fiddly dee. As I turned the corner I, by luck, saw a HSBC branch and merrily entered. I asked a few questions to the staff about rates, eligibility etc., and merrily exited. I saw another bank, Commonwealth, an intimidating looking bank with security watching my every move. I again entered, chatted to a member of staff and exited. As I continued my hunt, a bank grabbed my attention with its Orange logo and its offer of a high interest current account. Bank West; I walked in, it felt more intimate than the other financial institutions, more like a set of stalls than a shop front. I was immediately invited to take a seat and skim through their list of retail banking products. I was immediately drawn to their most basic product, a check account with no debit card. The interest on the account was sky high. Given the financial crisis that had gripped the UK at the time, driving its interest rates to an historic low, anything north of 2%was special. Bank West we’re offering a ridiculously high 5%. It was a good time to be in Australia and earning Aussie dollars; it was seeing boom time thanks to an ever-expanding Chinese economy churning through Australia’s raw materials. After handing over a copy of my British passport and a copy of my signature I was an official Australian bank account holder. How easy was that? Me, David “the foreigner” Clarke, with no fixed address and barely a penny to my name. I had walked into a bank and now held an Australian blank account in my name. Cool, one task down, one to go, or so I thought. There were still 2 tasks if you count the application for a tax file number (TFN). A TFN was the equivalent of a National Insurance Number, a unique identifier that all people working in Australia must have. How else would the government distribute the country’s wealth? The accountant at K.J.Ross & Associates, a guy called Lyndon, had my tax affairs at hand I thought… He sent me a form to fill in, which I astutely completed and returned detailing my worldly assets (none that were of any noticeable worth). Lyndon subsequently sent me an excel spreadsheet that calculated my living away from home allowance (LAFHA) based on my current financial standing. LAFHA was a tax break for employees sourced from abroad to fill the needs of the Australian work force. Simply speaking, K.J.Ross would use it to pay for my rent. I remember looking at the wage calculations that Lyndon had generated. My mathematics aren’t too shabby, but his finance calculations baffled me. When I cannot understand any calculations, I feel belittled. My reaction is one of anger with thoughts of been taken for a ride. ‘F*ck you Lyndon!’ immediately entered my consciousness. My wages according to my contract were $100,000 before tax. I thought it was cool earning a six-figure salary. Given the exchange rate at the time, AU$1.8 to the £, I was set to earn the highest wage of my life. Given though, the higher price of living in Sydney, Australia, my dollars wouldn’t be stretching as far…Hey, anyway, at least I was going to be earning a wage after a good 2 months of being without. Even though I was unsure if what I was earning was correct. I did have spending money to tide me by,AU$1000 to be exact. With the accommodation paid for by the consultancy coffers for the next couple of weeks, all I really had to financially concern myself with was the cost of food, drink and transport, which was nice. Food was expensive, the Coles or Woolworths supermarkets were the cheapest food outlets. The proliferous, open 24-hours, 7-11 stung the shopper on prices. The price you pay for convenience. In the U.K. I had developed a taste for Gap “twisted” jeans and protein. The latter was a consequence of vanity, pursued through the many gym sessions I enjoyed each week. In Australia I naturally hovered around the cooked food section of any supermarket. My focus was on deals; the cooked chicken section was large, it always offered discounts. Portions ranged from quarter, half to full. There were the other cuts too: drumsticks, wings and thighs, but rarely available at discount. The ultimate find, a reduced-price half portion of chicken with stuffing. To complement the “dirty bird” I would purchase a salad portion (as a cursory tick in the box to being healthy). There is something that I enjoy, vegans would be appalled, ripping cooked meat off an animal’s carcass using bare hands and teeth. I likened eating cooked chicken to a game of hide and seek; pieces of cooked flesh, I am coming, ready or not! Searching a carcass for any meat hidden away, for me, was a joy of eating. If I had to prioritise the pleasures of eating it would be:

1. Presentation
2. Flavour
3. Texture, including handling food

Australian cooked chicken was naturally salty. I assumed at the time that salt was added to the bird, the Australian’s preference. In fact, it was a consequence of the chicken’s diet. You are what you eat. Salty tasting chicken is raised on salty foods. The chicken was unusually greasy too, sickeningly so. The combined chicken grease and buttery stuffing could cause stomach upsets. The key was to eat slowly and use plenty of paper towels to mop the grease off the face and surfaces. Australia is where I discovered a love for several the more exotic fruits: the avocado and the mango to name but two. Mangos were in season in November and were on sale. They were messy; the fibrous tissue always got stuck between the teeth. The excessive, viscous juice always rolled down the chin and collected on my t-shirt. It was all worth it; the sweet reward is difficult to describe. “A taste sensation” is a term I use to describe a flavour that makes me smile. Smiling is something I did often in this new, bright, “t-shirt, shorts, and mango fruit” environment.

### Same work, different climate

A couple of days had passed, what had I achieved? I had a bank account, but my TFN was still being processed and I needed a mobile phone contract. Apart from those niggly to do items I had nothing to worry about…so I thought. It was another bright and warm day, t-shirt and shorts? Not today, today was to be day one of work. It was to be, as it was in the rest of the western white-collar world, suited and booted. Thankfully I came prepared; the Hugo Boss suit, one my brother picked up for me at Frankfurt airport, was hanging neatly in the wardrobe. I decided to leave wearing the jacket, a wise move given the humid climate. The Sydney office of KJRA was in the suburb in North Sydney. Being a rambler, I decided to go on foot, which meant negotiating the Sydney Harbour Bridge. As I began my walk from the accommodation could feel the perspiration pour down my back. I was a sweater, but it took a good heat to begin the process and only my back was noticeably affected. One thing I never concerned myself with in the UK was my hydration levels whilst walking. In Australia I now had to account for new level of humidity. In North Sydney, on entering the high-rise building premises I was met with a friendly face at reception. “K.J.Ross and Associates?”, I asked. “7th floor”, replied the front office staff. On exiting the lift on the 7thfloor I peered at the business name plaques that lay before me. I turned left and noticed the vacant kitchen area that included a “posh coffee” machine. I made a mental note to make use of that later. It was easy to locate the K.J.Ross and Associates office. As I opened the door I noticed staplers here, folders there, mountains of laptops somewhere else. It was a bloody mess by all intents and purposes. In the corner of the office appeared a 6 foot plus, well-built man in a suit. My thoughts immediately were “This is the guy that Mark told me about”. He failed to contact me on many occasions. This was going to be my first communications with him. “You must be Dave” he said in a quintessential, deep, Australian droll. “Bruce, I’m responsible for Sydney operations”, he extended his hand and I firmly shuck it. “Sorry about the mess” he exclaimed, “we’re in the process of moving.” Bruce’s appearance and manner conveyed a sense of importance. This disguised his actual role at KJRA, pre-sales i.e. drumming up potential business. Bruce was a scatterbrain, which didn’t lend itself well to the level of change ahead. He tried his best to play host, introduce me into the company mix, sales meetings and the pending office move. First things first as it was in Australian culture, host. Bruce gave me a quick tour of the office and the facilities on the floor. He, importantly, showed me how to operate the coffee machine. The resultant “frothy coffee” was delicious and quenched my thirst. We returned to the office and back to the subject of business. Bruce briefed me on client work at a financial institute E*Trade, a subsidiary of ANZ, another Southern Hemisphere financial giant. The work was basically the same as the work I had done in the UK, test automation. Bruce looked around frantically in his unorganised office for a phone number. He finally managed to find and dial it. After a few rings, Bruce in his deep Aussie accent said “Mark?”. Mark quickly replied, “Hi Bruce”. “I have Dave Clarke here in the office, I’ll put us on speaker phone.” Mark Pedersen elaborated on the role and questioned my experience. “Dave, you’ve got HP QTP experience?” HP QTP was an industry standard software tool commonly used at the time. Mark mentioned I should talk to “our man in the field”, a KJRA consultant called Cuong Pham working at ANZ, for even further information on the role. I frantically searched for a pen and piece of paper to note his contact details. The speaker phone call from Mark was ended and a more in-depth, one-to-one call with Cuong was initiated. Cuong began with a reference to what the test automation industry called a “keyword driven framework”. Up until that point I had only heard of that term but had never used keyword driven test automation solution. As soon as he mentioned this I got excited, given its potential impact on my future career. The experience would make me even more valuable to the IT industry. I confirmed that I had the necessary appetite (but maybe not necessarily the experience) to implement Cuong’s automation framework at E*Trade. Thankfully, Cuong mentioned he was happy to offer on-site assistance. Fantastic, I ended the phone call feeling confident, the “man on the field” was only a phone call away. The “gig” wouldn’t happen till the following week given the financial industry’s red tape. I was frustrated, I wanted to start now, it had been a long time since I sniffed any test automation. For now, I had a while to relax and offer my services to Mr Bruce Rawsthorne. Bruce had an air of importance about him, and a sense of childish fun. His soft, fun side was a welcome contrast to the façade of importance. I would get to familiarise myself with these 2 sides to Bruce over the next few days. Bruce was brought in primarily as a salesperson, selling consultant resources, to potential clients. He brought me along to his client meetings, as far as I could gather, to:

1. keep him company.
2. show off; there was that sense of “watch this, I’m going to sell snow to an Eskimo“.
3. add some “software testing meat” to the sales conversation. Bruce thought he knew sales; he didn’t know software testing.
4. act as a “lamb to the slaughter”.

I was an actual available resource, ready to provide a service at their signing of contract. I had never, in the years working as a consultant in the UK, experienced a consultancy service sales meeting. I enjoyed it; what’s not to like:• I didn’t need to say a word if I didn’t want to; Bruce could metaphorically talk the legs off a wooden horse.• I got a free frothy coffee, in some cases I would get a free lunch. Well, food that was compliments of the Bruce and the consultancy, as I would find out, wasn’t exactly free. When Bruce hung up his business shoes, which varied from day to day given his business meetings, he was happy to head home, to work of course. Being the great guest that he was, and knowing I knew no-one, he would see to it that I should be invited. Bruce’s home was situated in the beautiful suburb of Manly. It is a paradise, just far enough away from the city and close enough to unspoilt coastline that it still felt remote. It could be accessed in a roundabout way by road. The best and least stressful way to access Manly was by ferry. There were two services that departed from Circular Quay at very regular intervals: fast and regular. The Fast Cat (short for catamaran) ferry operated when the water in Sydney harbour was pancake flat. The regular, more robust standard ferry would operate whatever the conditions. The heaviest of these could literally turn the ferry on its side and the stomach inside out. It was a life affirming experience; I often thought about kissing the Manly pier in gratitude for being alive on arrival. Bruce was a Fast Cat man; he liked to be seen hanging out with people in the upper echelons of Manly life. Bruce loved the excesses and deep down wanted to be rich and famous. Maybe his thoughts about rubbing shoulders with the rich would rub off on his financial and career aspirations. Bruce was a generous person, which ran contrary to the financially astute nature of the rich. He liked to see it that I was paid for, and that he was reimbursed for his troubles by the consultancy. Before I had the chance to get cash out of my wallet, Bruce stepped in. “Dave don’t worry mate, I’ve got this” he confidently announced as went about purchasing a travel ticket at the vacant ticket machine. Bruce handed me a credit card sized piece of card and led me to the back of a short queue. After the hoy balloy arriving passengers got their diamond encrusted shoes onto dry land, we the departing replacements were allowed on board. The two decks had ample space, the upper was fuller, and filled with suited and booted businessmen. This behaviour is common in the animal kingdom e.g., a male howler monkey announces his presence to other groups by getting to the top of the tallest tree and bellowing. The bellowing on the Fast Cat was influenced by pre-boarding cans of alcohol, purchased from the circular quay terminal convenience stores. Bruce was no exception; he has bought a bag load of “Bundy” (Bundaberg) and coke mixer cans. Bundaberg, a region in Queensland, Australia, was the namesake of the famous Aussie rum, which was surprisingly, and dangerously, tasty. Given Bruce’s regular showing on board, he recognised several people, but wasn’t on a conversational level with them. Instead he said “hi” and passed by. His calm demeanour soon turned into a rushed 2-step as he noticed someone on the top-deck. Bruce yelled “Doug!” Doug was unaware of his good friend’s presence and continued to look on. Bruce’s 2-step turned into a tango as he rushed on, dragging me with him, to get to the top deck. “Doug, there you are. Why the f*ck didn’t you turn around when I shouted” Bruce said in a nettled tone. “Dave, this is Doug, Doug, this is Dave.” Doug, a New Zealander was Like most of the kiwis I was to meet, they were well built. Doug was no exception, he was a good six feet tall, had little in the way of hair, Mediterranean complexion and built like a human tank. He was closer to my age than Bruce’s. He gave an air of confidence: shoulders were firmly back; his suit was immaculate, and his sunglasses were rimmed with gold. Doug worked as a consultant at the Commonwealth Bank; he bragged about the bad situation the company was in. Doug knew Bruce from time back when they were flat mates. Bruce’s behaviour changed around Doug. The business façade that Bruce tried to put on from 9-till-5 was replaced with a sniggering, droll demeanour. The two of them were like a scripted double act. Bruce would, with perfect timing, contributed to Doug’s scandalous stories. The conversation between Doug and Bruce moved onto “the buddies”, a group of drinking buddies they met up with each week. The person at the centre of the chat was Glenn and his girlfriend Andi. I was to find out soon that these two people would become a bigger part of my life over the coming weeks. On reaching Sydney Harbour we disembarked and made our way to the Bavarian Beer Café, a chain of German themed bars that adorned Sydney. I felt like a 5th wheel in the conversation as Doug and Bruce continued to chat about work and engross themselves in their past glories. I was less mesmerised by the conversation and more by the way he handled his beer glass. I could sense by the way Bruce was a seasoned drinker. The schooner was an extension of his body language as he lavished in the foretelling of his extravagant life moments. Beer was social lubrication for Bruce; he unwound, pouring insights into his pre-marriage life. I could tell from the details of his stories that he still wanted to be one of the lads. It was apparent from his stories of old that Bruce had led a diverse life. Bruce, at some point in his life, had lived over in America for a short period of time as a skiing instructor. Supposedly this was something that a lot of Australians that had finished their University studies did. I never asked him how and why Australians did this? ‘Where did Aussies learn to ski?’ It was a subject for the Google search engine. He was also Doug’s old flat mate and pre-marriage wingman. The pad they had, in days gone by, rented in Manly could only be described as a shagging stable, or so it was portrayed. These stories, especially after a few steins, could easily be embellished. Bruce had worked as a promoter too, working for a company that takes clients out on Party Boats around Sydney Harbour. The parties, according to his stories, got a little too loud for the authorities and were often cut short. Bruce told a story that every English person would love to hear, which made me chuckle, a story about an ex-girlfriend of his. He mentioned her name, Sheila. The conclusion of the story was “I had to leave her after realising that if we married, the bride and groom to be would have been Bruce and Sheila!”. Bruce had been married twice. His first marriage was one more out of juvenile pleasure, instead of a long-term commitment. He and his wife regretfully had to end that commitment early. His current wife, Tiffany, or Tiff as she was known to the masses, was heavily pregnant with Bruce's son to be. She was an amazing lady, a personality akin to a rising sun: She was full of warmth, energy and enthusiasm. The latter was something lacking in my personality. The sun was slowly setting. Doug was finishing his second drink, a Bundy and Coke. He looked down at the large, ornate time piece on his wrist and opened his eyes widely to show a surprised expression. He placed his empty glass down, raised his sunglasses and embraced Bruce. Joyfully he exhaled “See you bro, got to get home to the wifey.” He released the embrace and shook my hand firmly. He returned his sunglasses to his nose and adjusted his man bag around his plush, lightly coloured, unfettered suit. Bruce checked his watch and mentioned that Glenn was going to be arriving soon. Bruce cast an eye towards the sea-ward horizon. “Dave have a look at that” he said, indicating I should look at the sun setting. With an Aussie droll that felt like it lasted minutes, he said “Isn’t it beeeeee-youuuuu-tiful!” There was more to Bruce than his laddish exploits had me believe. I could sense he loved the outdoor life and was in touch with the Australian coastal landscape. Glenn eventually materialised; he was another “fast-ferry-goer” with an image to match. Glenn was terser than any other Aussie I had met thus far. He was one of the most complex characters I had met so far too. He wasn’t the open, approachable type; My fly on the wall existence became swatted as he chatted to Bruce. He didn’t stay for long, he had little reason to, given he didn’t drink. Closer to the truth it was more about his girlfriend Andy, she didn’t allow him to drink. Bruce talked about Glenn as a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde type of character. His Mr Hyde, also known as Stifler (from American Pie movie fame), reared its ugly head after he consumed copious amounts of alcohol. I wondered if Glenn was an alcoholic. Anyway, Andy kept the boozy Mr Hyde in check. She knew just how destructive drink was to Glenn’s health and their relationship. Soon after Glenn left for home, Bruce made his excuses, turned on his business personality and replayed Doug’s “surprise and check watch” body language. Anyway, it was a good time to be heading back to the mainland, the last ferry out of Manly to Circular Quay was moments away from departing. The next morning, I got into the North Sydney office later than expected. I could see Bruce in his office. He looked preoccupied with his laptop, which he duly closed and quickly hobbled towards me. I never noticed the hobble before; Bruce winced and said “bloody leg, I should get it looked at. Right, I’m late for a sales meeting. See you ladies later.” As he continued to hurriedly hobble home, he said that Elliot, his second in command, would be arriving at the office soon. I took the company laptop out of the K.J.Ross branded backpack, made some space on the dishevelled table and fired up a web browser. There was still much for me to organise. One thing on my mind, which should have bothered me more given I was nearing my first week at the work digs, was my living arrangements. Only a week remained until I would need to find a new place to live. In the UK I had never rented, or house shared. I had the mindset of living on my own and paying a mortgage. Renting was going to be a big change. Unfortunately, finding a place to rent near Sydney CBD was difficult. In addition, finding affordable housing for a Joe on Software Testers wages was next to impossible. Looking at the estate agent websites, my hopes were rightfully dashed. Many people I spoke to in Sydney said I should investigate house shares. I am a stubborn sole; It was either find a place to rent by myself in Manly or nothing! Why Manly? To quote Bruce, Manly was “beeeeee-youuuuu-tiful”. Elliot materialised, popping his head in and saying hello. Elliot was a lanky, baby face, looking more like a20 something than a mid-thirty something. He had an expression of joy that lit up the room. His eyes portrayed intensity that contrasted his kind smile. Elliot extended his hand, which I shook firmly “you must be Dave, Bruce mentioned you’d be in the office. Elliot Caldwell, I’m working alongside Bruce to drum up business here in Sydney. Not long now until the E*TRADE gig” he clucked. “Yep, we’ve got you signed up for an initial 2 weeks of POC (proof of concept) work. That will be extended. With Cuong’s support we’ll get the ANZ test automation framework ported over as quick as.” Elliot asked if I’d had a coffee… “No” I merrily replied. “Right, I just need to read a few emails. We should head to a coffee shop around the corner where they sell proper coffees. “Elliot loved his “frothy coffees”, a term in my lexicon that would soon be replaced with the term “proper coffees”. Elliot’s taste in coffees were over the top: multi-shot Espresso-based drinks with at least a pint of steamed milk. He sourced his caffeine hit from a local café, at most, two blocks away from the office. I was fresh faced to the coffee scene, having not embraced the infantile industry in the UK. Having now spent time with Bruce and Elliot, coffee appeared to be an integral part of the day-time social culture. Drinking the dark nectar was an acceptable excuse, much like going out for a cigarette, to have a chinwag. Elliot was a master in the art of the looking busy yet getting away with doing nothing. His voice projection, tone, pace and vocal variety was textbook. Whatever he said was impactful. As we sat outside the conveniently located café, Elliot puffing away on his B&H, he did not hold back telling his life story. The significant events he mentioned in his life were his divorce, his 2 young daughters (5 and 7years old) and his English born mother. I could tell he was fond of English people by his constant sledging of them. I felt that he trusted me, given his venerable willingness to be open about his life. I felt that just being in people’s presence, lending an ear, I could gain their trust. Given how outspoken each Australian had been thus far, it wasn’t difficult to use my listening skills. It was a role reversal for me; at home around my friends, it was me who was then outspoken one… It made me realise, by comparison, how unselfish and willing my friends were to listen. The E*TRADE building was like many in Sydney CBD, a modern skyscraper. The ground floor shared its space with shops and eateries; the latter was business focussed and dedicated to a range of mostly Asian tastes. When the weekend came around these food retail spaces were like ghost towns. I, as I normally did at all new client sites, headed over to the reception and asked for my representative. The security guard picked up the phone, chatted with someone and acknowledged that the person was on their way. I proceeded to sit and wait; dressed to impress, I wore a Hugo Boss suit my brother bought me from its design homeland of Germany. My Ted Baker pinstripe shirt hailed from New Street, Birmingham. I donned an equally elaborate tie combo that glistened when the angle of the lighting was perfect. The fashionable combo, given the hot, moist Sydney conditions, was a little uncomfortable to wear, but fine for the air-conditioned confines of the modern office building. My representative, Srikanth, finally arrived. He appeared timid, lacking eye contact; his heavily Indian accented mumble projected towards the floor. The rotund, moustached man of Indian descent was clearly stressed; I was aware that I was an encumbrance on his working day. As he approached, I did what was engrained in me in the matters of social protocol: I tried to look him straight in the eyes, smile and offer my hand to cordially shake his. Given I couldn’t get eye contact, I didn’t bother proceeding. Srikanth directed me to security, where I was handed a temporary pass before being escorted to the main lift. As we entered, Srikanth swiped his pass and pressed the button corresponding to our floor. He sheepishly asked me “how are you?” I could sense his social discomfort; a far cry from the more laidback general Aussie question “How ya going?” In both cases a simple “good” would have sufficed, but I can at times take a question and run with the answer if I felt in the mood. The instance that Srikanth asked, that’s exactly what I did, to his bemusement. I took this rare opportunity to voice my opinion. The Aussies I had met thus far, mainly Bruce and Elliot, left little room for me to talk. I literally talked Srikanth’s ears off as the lift ascended and approached our floor. As the lift doors parted I could sense Srikanth’s relief, this and the huge E*TRADE sign that stood before me. He chaperoned me across the E\*Trade floor space and over to the desk of a European looking bloke. Before he opened his mouth, I could tell from his body language and his dress sense that he was an Englishman. He swivelled his seat round, looked up at Srikanth and then at me. Srikanth beamed as Daniel, the level-headed English fellow, stood up slowly and offered a handshake. “You must be from K.J.Ross and Associates” he exclaimed as he drew another Slurpee breath. “Do you have everything you need?” Srikanth asked Daniel. “Yep, I’ve got the test automation software download available on a share that I should be able to access from any PC connected to the network.” Like a flash he was out of his seat with a keen eye on getting the most of me. I followed Daniel to a cubicle with 4 Windows PCs and an Apple Mac. This area was the “multi-platform rig” the team used as the final quality check before giving it the green light for promotion into production. It was now going to be polluted with my test automation software set for installation on each Window’s PC. Daniel booted up the first PC and jokingly positioned himself such that he shielded his presence while he tapped in the administrator username and password on the login screen. As the windows desktop appeared it was then time to search for the installation files. Daniel slowly and delicately tapped in the path to the directory, his eyes moving erratically from paper to keyboard to screen. He hit the Enter key with a great deal of force to signify task completion. He looked up at the PC monitor and located the file he was looking for, much to his elation. He double clicked on said file, which prompted an error. A sigh of frustration exited his braced teeth. “What’s then issue now?” he trumped. Breathing out heavily he hesitantly moved his eyes away from the screen and back to his piece of paper. “Right, wait here, I’ll be back soon. I just need to email IT Security to resolve this.” IT Security were in no way thugs in uniform, like many security guards, which was the case for IT Security Officer John. They were tough though, tough on all things IT Security. If you wanted to copy a file from an external USB drive, John would be ready to come down on you like a proverbial ton of bricks. When Daniel asked John if he could update the privileges of the admin account to permit installation of software, John frowned. “Sorry Daniel I can’t do that”, he said in an Anglicised Australian accent. He continued, “but I can install the file for you using my elevated privileges.” He tapped a few keys and low and behold the install sprung into life. The first prompt appeared on the screen, which made John feel edgy. “What should I select here?” He read the options aloud. Daniel looked at me for direction. I installed some confidence in them both by quickly replying with the required option. The next prompt appeared, Daniel looked at me again, I again promptly advised. After a few more prompts the screen was ablaze with progress bar activity. The three of us stood there like the 3 amigos, arms crossed, waiting. Daniel was the first to break the silence as he quizzed John with a tone indicating an element of foolhardiness and comical wit. “So, John, how’s the security team?” John’s eyes didn’t leave the screen as he answered in a quick-fire manner that was enthusiastic yet reserved. “Well, we’re getting version control installed on all the machines in the coming weeks”, he clucked. “Full roll out is planned to be completed by years end” he exclaimed. I could sense Daniel wasn’t too bothered about the answer. Asking a question for question’s sake. “How’s the family?” Daniel continued. “Good” John continued, “Mother just got back from surgery last week, she’s doing well.” John was quick to point out that his mother was English, which explained the Anglicised accent. “Right, it looks like the installation has finished. Do you need any further assistance?”, affirmed John. Daniel smiled, gently nodded with a closed mouth “no”, he said. Daniel, graciously and jokingly, thanked John for his help as the login screen appeared once again. As John trundled off, Daniel logged back in and launched the freshly installed test automation software. “Over to you Dave” he indicated. I asked a few questions about the application under test before selecting the correct options and continuing. I demonstrated the automation software was working as expected. Daniel smiled, “Right, the next thing we need to do is get Cuong’s framework setup and we should be away.” “That should be enough for today; we’ll reconvene tomorrow.”

## Chapter 5

### Vagabond

The next couple of weeks were a blur. In drinking and socialising terms, yeah, a lot happened. I was seeing Bruce, Elliot and people at E*TRADE on a regular basis. Bruce, in Manly, Elliot, out west in Annandale and E*TRADE, smack bang in the CBD. One thing that I hoped, but didn’t effortfully procure, was a new rental property. My tenure at the consultancy accommodation had come to an end; I was left to fend for myself in temporary accommodation located in the Sydney concrete jungle. It was an unnerving, comfort zone pushing experience having to move from pillar-to-post each day. Packing, unpacking my suitcases and backpack, I got by (in the loosest sense). One day it was hostel accommodation in the CBD, the next it was a temporary house share in Manly. Much can be said about having a place that you call home. From day-to-day it’s difficult enough dealing with the stresses of anew workplace. Having to adjust the daily routine for each place of temporary accommodation was one more thing I could do without. What was worse, I was booking the cheapest single room accommodation I could find at the last minute. Accordingly, there was little availability and high prices. For my sanity and wallet, I couldn’t afford to do this indefinitely. The move was on, not just for me, but the entire Sydney based KJRA team. The A-Team, consisting of me, Bruce and Elliot, saw fit to load up Elliot’s Tardis like Holden Carlton with the contents of the North Sydney office. Amazingly, it only took 3 trips to clear all the contents of the “old” North Sydney premises. The new, compact, centrally located Circular Quay Office was packed to the rafters with, to be blunt, crap! The number of KJRA training manuals available to the Sydneysiders had reached epic proportions. This material, equal in professional quality content to that of the international standard, was unheard of outside Australia… This was purely down to lack of marketing. Mark had told me the story; it could have been the global software testing standard, but another body was faster to market.
K.J.Ross and Associates, as I was to find out, had an interesting history. It was created by one man, a humble doctorate in Computer Science, Doctor Kelvin Ross. He had the brilliant idea of shepherding some of the academic community at Queensland University (his back yard). These academics, with a software engineering background, would become his software testing consultants. Some would focus teaching software testing theory whilst others would provide businesses a resource to implement the theory. The result, a consultancy of Rolls-Royce resources, executing their work to the highest of industry’s standards. They were loyal to the cause, Kelvin and his consultancy, but lacked direction. Kelvin, the owner, coming from the background of academia, wasn't business savvy. This was where Mark came in; He was given the title of Chief Operating Officer (COO), to fuel a direction. Mark had one plan in mind, copy the goal to success that aided the rise and takeover of Cresta, the first testing consultancy I worked for. Mark was viewed as one of the men behind Cresta’s success. Why then did the likes of Elliot and Bruce work for K.J.Ross & Associates. Their backgrounds didn’t fit with the rest of the business. One trait they exuded by the bucket load was the propensity to bullshit. Mark was well and truly wrapped around, in the case of Elliot, his cigarette-stained, little finger. The art of bullshitting, and it truly is an art, had got them a foot in the door at K.J.Ross & Associates Office venture in Sydney. So far it was going smoothly, Bruce was the logistics captain, having chosen the new Circular Quay office premises. He assigned himself the position of Sydney office boss. It’s a shame he was a glorified salesman, and to call him a salesman would be an insult to the job title. By definition, a salesman sells stuff. I had witnessed Bruce’s sales prowess first-hand. Let it be said, the man would have difficulty selling Thylacines (the extinct Tasmanian Tigers) to Tasmania. “Mr Playford”, those words should be enunciated with a deep, smooth UK radio presenters’ tone, was the next K.J.Ross newbie to be installed in the Sydney office. Dave was a Canadian man in his forties, with a hew to his face that said much about his drinking habits. The finely groomed, minge-bearded man was a mouth of soft mumbles. He was, by Canadian standards, a quiet bloke. The intense, wide-eyed stare gave an indication of his focus. He wasn’t focussed purely on the work that he had to complete, he was concerned with the focus applied to keeping his head in the realms of reality. Unfortunately, he suffered from shades of Asperger’s, which made him a little less sociable, but allowed him to plough through technical solutions. Contracts pertaining to the delivery of test automation at E*TRADE were still in the process of being written up. While in the new K.J.Ross Sydney office, Dave Playford, Elliot and I ran through course material. With Elliot as the assigned teacher, what that man couldn’t apply himself to could be written on the back of a postage stamp, and Bruce out selling business, we had lots of bench time. Bench time was what any consultancy feared, a time when resources earned no money for the business. Truth be told, we covered lots of course material and obtained lots of certificates, showing just how much of K.J.Ross’s money we had burnt. During my time in the K.J.Ross office, I would consistently head in around 9am. Dave would turn up a little later because of the almighty 2-hour journey he had to endure. Elliot and Bruce would roll in as and when. Working from home was always an option for Elliot and Bruce. Their relationship was an interesting one. They didn’t always see eye-to-eye and often bitched about each other behind each other’s backs. The issues they had were many: machismo, power mongering and who had the better sales technique. Mark talked about the old Sydney team before his arrival. In Sydney, K.J.Ross was a two men strong team: Joel Decherd, a performance test specialist working at Commonwealth Bank and Elliot Caldwell, the “lend his hand to anything” specialist, which included sales, but he also did well as a client liaisons manager. Mark saw fit to hire a new salesman, Bruce, and let Elliot focus on making money for the business by working on client site. As with any major change, especially one around roles, Bruce’s arrival had flustered the sure-footed Elliot. Elliot, when not working for the client, continued to follow up on leads and answer any of K.J.Ross’s Sydney office phone queries. Both Bruce and Elliot were optimistic to the point of constantly bullshitting. Whilst talking to the duo, I often acted out in my head breathing in heavily through gapingly wide nostrils to indicate a whiff of a bad smell. There was the adage, especially from Elliot, that we didn’t have enough members of staff to fill the abundant roles that companies were throwing our way. The leads we had “pouring in” were few and far between.

## Chapter 6

### Another Day in Paradise

Everyone I had met so far were accommodating, Bruce was by far the most generous. Knowing I was having grief finding a place to stay he got me in touch with his drinking buddy, Glenn, who wanted to meet me first. So, one lunch time, on a hot summer's day in Sydney CBD, I walked into a pub. I just about noticed Glenn; he was sat in a booth, suited and booted, next to an equally dapper looking colleague. Glenn stood up, gave me an unwavering, expressionless look and shook my hand. The expression on my face suddenly changed, from one of a relaxed, whimsical joy, to one of fear. The feeling of formality was eerily like an interview. Glenn looked me up and down like a notice on a parking meter and went in like a vulture into a fresh carcass. “What is your name? Where are you from? What year is it? Who is the Prime Minister?” (the last two questions were made up by me, sorry). His stare didn’t leave my gaze; I could not to look away, he probably would have killed me if I did. The questioning continued; the intensity of the questioning abated somewhat after a few minutes. I sensed he was satisfied with my answers up until that point. Glenn’s spiel trajectory changed from questioning to statements; he began stating the apartment rules. It was like listening to the laws of Fight Club (a film starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton). Just like the rules of fight club, I thought he was going to apply the same slant to the apartment I.e., the first rule of the apartment is... there is no apartment. He didn’t, much to my dismay. He mentioned I could stay at the apartment from next week. The last day of the stay would be up until one week before Christmas. Everything was verbally agreed, nothing to sign, sweet. That would give me three weeks to search for a new apartment. Plenty of time? The second week of December came along. I was all smiles, having spent a few weeks living in cheap inner city hostels I was looking forward to some stability on the home front. One early evening I made my way to Glenn’s apartment over in Queenscliff, Sydney. I was baking hot, walking along the sidewalk of Manly Beach thanks to my long British style winter jacket. It was an effort walking up the hill to reach the ground floor of the apartment. I looked at the text he sent me; Keys are located under the front sidewheel of the pick-up truck. That sounded straightforward enough, there was only one pickup on the drive. I took a “man look” under the front side passenger wheel, nothing… Maybe Glenn meant the other passenger wheel, nothing. I looked under the whole car and saw nothing. Bugger! Where the hell were the keys? I thought of my below par searching efforts, “let’s have a proper feel” were my next thoughts. I ran my hand thoroughly around the passenger side wheel. Yep, they must have been slightly out of reach previously as the jingle-jangle sound joyously sung to my ears. Like a “level-up” scene out of video game I held the keys aloft. I approached the tiny lift on the ground floor and hit the call button. As the sardine can of a lift opened, I was happy to see no one inside. “Now, where is the button to floor 3” I said out loud. The lift door opened, a plushily carpeted landing led to the door of many apartments. The door in front was white, modern and inviting. I tried the keys, a turn to the left confirmed a success with a unresisted clunk! I nodded my head affirmatively; my head and eyes swept the space that lay before me. I was amazed at the size, and thanks to huge windows, brightness that filled the interior. The centre piece of the apartment was a 50” flat screen TV placed the perfect distance from the sofa. My heart raced in the knowledge that I would one day get to indulge in this audio-visual showpiece. My phone pinged, indicating a text; It read “I hope you found your way into the apartment. Andy is on her way; she’ll be happy to show you round. Glenn” I tentatively perched my bottom on the edge of the sofa and proceeded to melt into the core of the cushions. The thought “could life be any better than this moment right now?” circled in my head like birds of prey soaring in the updraft. Andy opened the door, shopping bags in hand, she directed a “hey” my way before beckoning the cats to the kitchen. Andy had presence; she was a good 5’9” without her heels, a New Zealander, tanned, toned, with piercing blue eyes. Her presence was very inviting on the eyes for that matter. After putting food items into the fridge and seeing to dishing out the cats’ dinner she turned her attentions towards me. “David is it? Hi, I’m Andy, Glenn’s partner.” “I’m not sure if Glenn has showed you around the place? I guess not with it being your first day at the apartment.” Andy began with showing me the kitchen, the lounge, the extensive balcony that ran around the perimeter and finally the spare bedroom. The bedroom was enormous and included an en suite. I plonked my belongings down and continued following Andy back to the kitchen where she offered me an Aussie brew labelled VB. I didn’t hesitate, I was parched. The bottle of beer was screw top and handed to me in a neoprene beer bottle blanket the Aussies call stubby holder. Aussies laughed about the British and their warm beer culture. Australians prided themselves on drinking ice cold beer, especially from a stubby (bottle).Andy began talking about the finer details of the new living arrangements, “Dave you need to”:1. “...be quiet if arriving back to the apartment late at night.”2. “...keep the apartment clean at all times.”3. “...keep this door closed because the cats could get out and injure themselves.”4. “...pay rent the equivalent of $300 (£150) per week. “The cost of rental was quite expensive, as rental agreements go, but heaps cheaper than staying at hotels. I looked outside and admired the horizon; the bright lights of Manly reflecting off the liquorice of lightly lapping sea. I took a final sip of the refreshing Australian beer and made my way into the lounge. My first night in the Queenscliff apartment was restful bliss. My eyes opened at the crack of dawn as the first beams of the sunlight’s orangey rays enveloped the bedroom. In a light sleep I pictured an orchestra of angels playing harp; that soft, angelic sound faded before a melodic drum beat kicked in. Phil Collins “Another Day in Paradise” began to play and my sate of being elevated to 11 on the Spinal Tap scale. I opened my eyes and gazed at the glass window of my balcony door. Like a scene from poltergeist, my body levitated and moved towards the light, out onto the balcony. I looked to my right and noticed a plethora of outdoor essentials including: A BBQ & well-worn wet suits. The air temperature was already 20 Degrees C, with a cool breeze sauntering off Queenscliff Beach. I walked to the corner of the balcony, posturing for the best view of the beach below. The beach was packed; even though it was the weekend the kids were being schooled, exchanging their books for life saver activities. There was a wet suited colony of surfers out in a spot in the ocean off Queenscliff Beach waiting to catch the next wave in. I looked further into the distance and admired the sun glow behind the decadent Shelley Beach. I took a deep breath, the salty sea air tingled at the back of my nostrils. ‘Could life get any better than this moment right now?’ I thought yet again. I headed slowly back inside to the lounge. The huge TV seemed to stare at me blankly as I visited the kitchen. I took out a box of Weetbix, a cereal I had recently discovered in the local Coles store, and tentatively thought about sampling it. Weetbix was not simply a misspelt Weet-a-bix (the British branded) copy. Weetbix had a greater depth of wheat-like flavour. It was larger and crumblier in texture; an Australia's taste sensation. Talking of taste sensations there were many that Australia offered. I didn’t know it at the time, but it was mango season. Fresh mango flavoured produce was cheap, given high supply from neighbouring state Queensland. The soft, yellow, ridiculously sweet, fibrous fruit tasted delectable. The other fruit high on the flavour stakes was the beautiful watermelon and the dragon fruit, also grown in tropical Queensland. Tropical fruit grown locally tasted much sweeter than the imported UK supermarket equivalent I was used to. Coffee, was always beautiful, prepared to a high standard in every café and sourced, in some cases from, you guessed it, a farm in Queensland. A type of cuisine that was spawning a new type of restaurant was the gourmet burger. Manly, arguably had the best Gourmet Burger joint in the world, Benbry Burger. Around the corner was a New Zealand burger joint; it offered a different slant on the burger offering. Benbry Burger was by far better value for money. It was often packed to the rafters with customers most nights with “wallet watchers” from the nearby hostel. Who could blame their meagre money stretching? For under AU$10 you set a succulent, Aussie-fied example of a premium beef pate(which meant it contained avocado) and a sample of fries. For a smidgeon more you can upsize and add a drink, increasing the cost to \$10.It wasn’t all about American style food in Manly. The British had established their mark on Aussie culture at its inception as a European extended state. Fish and chip shops were everywhere; most were run by “Asians” (a term the Aussies applied to anyone of far eastern decent). The layout was familiar to any fish and chip emporium purveyor. The main difference between it and its British cousin were the fish choices. Fancy some shark or red snapper? They were ever so slightly different from cod, haddock and plaice offerings from home. I had to admit it, the fish in Australia tasted better, but their chips were crap…Another culinary offering that hit the hearty was the pie. The Corso Bake House in Manly kept its doors opened late. Service was very fast; pies literally flew out the ovens and into the bellies of welcoming customers within seconds of ordering. Given the high turnover, as a punter you had to be careful not to devour the delicious compact meal too quickly. This was especially true when the pie contained a high-volume of sauce. In this instance it was a good idea to either wait 30 minutes or have a fire extinguisher to hand! My menu favourites were the curried chicken and the beef and mushroom. All served, as was tradition in Australia, a sachet of tomato ketchup. Beautiful! Back to life and back to a beautiful morning in Manly. I was relieved to see Bruce call round with a spare wetsuit. I wasn’t going to explore Manly to Shelley Beach cove in sub 20 degree C temperatures without one! Thankfully I had snorkelling equipment in my luggage, a purchase made during my PADI Scuba Diving course in the East Midlands. In the corner of Manly Beach there was a calm spot where Bruce and I donned our snorkelling apparel and walked our way out to deeper water. Bruce went off ahead and I followed. He didn’t wear fins, it agitated his leg, which was giving him jip of late. For a bloke that wasn’t wearing fins, he skimmed across the water like a stone. I found it difficult to keep up with him even with the aid of fins. The water appeared murky; it often did after a night of rainy conditions. I had to get my head out of the water to catch a glimpse of Bruce and his current position. I was soon getting into clearer waters; the shelves of the rocky seabed could now clearly be seen in the depths below. The underwater world appeared tranquil and beautiful. Schools of fish majestically moved in unison against the ebb and flow of the sea current. The larger fish hid themselves from view under the shelves within the rocky reef. Bruce dove down to inspect the underside of a rocky lip. I, with a sense of trepidation, took a deep breath through the snorkel and began a descent to see what more the underwater world offered. Not having dove so rapidly in prior sea swims, it came as a surprise to me how quickly the fluid pressure changed. My ears were the first sensory apparatus to feel the effects. This was quickly followed by my nose, the force of the goggles on my face was very uncomfortable. When I eventually surfaced, I realised my nose was bleeding. It didn’t take much to cause a bloody nose. Unfortunately, I suffered from weakened blood vessels as a result of habitual nose picking. Bruce indicated heading back to the safety of Manly Beach shore. Off he blasted in a froth of sea foam leaving me for dead. When I eventually reached shore; I could see Bruce effortfully take off his wet suit. Thank goodness he was around to assist me; I forgot just how difficult it was to get out of this essential wears! Bruce highlighted what he saw in the water. On his list was a turtle, a shark and a giant cuttlefish. None of these I saw. I did see a parrotfish which, by Bruce’s reckoning, are ten to the dozen. For an Englishman used to seeing greyer lake fish like roach, perch and pike, a parrotfish was something of an eye-opener. On reflection, the whole experience felt like I had switched from the UK’s black and white standard definition TV viewing experience to a one that was HD colour. The clarity and temperature of the water does wonders to the whole snorkelling experience.

## Chapter 7

### Lady of My Life

It was the approach to Christmas. Apart from applying good old-fashioned elbow grease on client sites, what other excessive work activities happen around that time of year? ...Work parties; the Christmas party, wherever I worked, topped the excess list. This year the KJR Christmas Party was to be held in early December. What I loved most about Christmas parties was their potential for unplanned activities. Simply stated, the path of a Christmas Party is controlled by 2 factors, money & ambition. Mark, the guy who hired me, made the special trip to Sydney from his home in Brisbane for such a prestigious occasion. It was to be his and my first Christmas Party. Mark had access to the company’s expense kitty meaning money wasn’t going to be the limiting factor. How ambitious were our intentions going to be? Is that a fridge full of beer in the office? Having never experienced an Australian Christmas I did not know what the protocol was. Bruce was on hand to ensure the Aussie experience was loosely adhered to. It would mean taking a trip from the work office to the Sydney Fish Market early on Friday afternoon. Why? An Australian Christmas would not be without prawns, lemons and Moreton Bay Bugs (a species of lobster). Sydney Fish Market was abuzz with activity; just like my recent snorkelling experience, I was amazed by the varieties of sea food on offer. The size of the sea creatures amazed me most.; the prawns were huge! Bruce knew which stall to head to. He didn’t take long to grab the attention of the fishmonger and land a huge order. With an ochre “here-ya”, the aromatic bags of seafood were passed from Bruce to me. The next stop was the bottle-o I.e., the off licence, to ensure the bevvies in the office’s beer fridge weren’t going to run out this side of Christmas. It was good I popped along; I was given leeway to choose whichever beers I so desired. Bruce was a huge admirer of the European Becks bottled beer, not predominantly for its taste, but for the image of class. I on the other had was an admirer of the Aussie beers that tried their best to imitate the English beers of old. Old dark beers were my tipple of choice, and none came better than a brace of beverage beauties, Toohey’s Old and Coppers Stout. I asked Bruce to grab several of both, forgetting that the rest of the staff were likely not to touch these far-right beers. With a fully stocked car of plastic bags, bevvies and prawns we headed back to the office. While Bruce and I were stocking away the bottled beers in the fridge Mark appeared with his weekend wheeled case. His upright, weighty, yet nimble stance gave an air of importance to his appearance. “Hi guys, Bruce, did you look into those new opportunities?” he quipped. Bruce blatantly ignored Mark’s question, choosing to distract himself with a relatively cold Becks that were soon to be refrigerated. Bruce ensured the seafood was easy to access and kept chilled by placing them into the Eskey (cool box). We immediately got stuck into the jumbo prawns. Mark saw me struggling with my peeling technique and offered his assistance. He asked me to watch, it took him literally seconds to peel and consume. “It’s all in the snapping of the head” he said. It is a coordinated action that is beautiful to behold. I watched with awe and tried unsuccessfully to imitate the technique. It didn’t stop us getting through a heft of the shelled critters. Soon the bins were filling up; the aroma of spilt beer and prawn digestive sacks was filling the office air. Admittedly, it did not bother us enough to leave the premises. Bruce, forever the awesome host, proposed we participate in a bit of gambling to while away the wee drinking hours. He suggested we play some club tunes to get us in the mood, post office drinking. Dave Playford admirably volunteered to play DJ; he hooked up the company laptop to the network and fired off tracks on Pandora, a free music streaming service. The party was just kicking off when Elliot and Joel entered the office. Elliot, forever smiling, lit up the room and introduced us all to the relatively old hand Joel. Bruce’s grin widened as he saw new punters to rope in on a game of Texas Holdem rules Poker. Bruce wanted to play for money, Mark refused, instead suggesting we play for sweets. We drank more, ate more, bet more and I won! We were in the mood to hit the town and leave the stench of prawn and beers behind. We called into various bars in and around Circular Quay, including a German themed bar that served some of the finest dark beer I have ever tasted, Hofbrau Dunkel. With the night beginning to turn up and our body coordination turning down, we ended up swaying over to Sydney’s top midnight club venue, The Argyle. I couldn’t believe I made it past the bouncers without stacking it; focus was key. The venue was dark, brash and loud, memories of the night became snapshots of which the following were forever enamoured:

- The bar area where Bruce, Mark, Joel and I drank at.
- Being left in Bruce’s company.
- Bruce and I speaking to 2 Aussie girls, managing somehow to get one of the girls to enter her phone number in my new-fangled Apple iPhone 3G.
- Some woman stealing my hat that I somehow procured from some other random person.
- Taking a piss in the unusual men’s room where the urinals were, from one angle, in view of the whole club!
- Happily eating a Macca’s (MacDonald’s) chicken burger and slurping down a strawberry milkshake.
- Half-arsedly opening the door to Queenscliff Apartment and thankfully locating my bedroom.
I somehow had the foresight, prior to the night out, to set my alarm for 9am. The default iPhone alarming tone rang. As I rose from my slumber, I scrambled to locate my phone. I hit the stop button immediately before returning to the land of nod. 30 minutes passed before the phone sounded again. This time round the sound was different, it wasn’t the alarm, it was someone trying to voice call me. I confusedly reached for the handset and accepted the call. With a “rough as arse holes” voice I said “hello.” “Is this David Clarke? We’re all here waiting for ya.” a cool Aussie voice announced. My half-cooked brain took a few seconds to process the question and statement…. ‘Ah shit’ I thought, ‘fuck, I’ve got that surfing lesson this morning’. More profanities echoed in my brain before I could think clearly. What did I do? I couldn’t think straight and needed an idea immediately. I hesitantly demanded “Could you wait half an hour?” The cool-headed Aussie said, “Nah mate, where are ya?” “Queenscliff” I replied. The bloke mentioned to be on the corner of Bridge Road and Grey Cliff Street in 5 minutes if I wanted to be picked up. I scrambled for my clothes, wet suit, deodorant and keys before legging it to the pick-up location. I reached the street corner; I could see a van with a heap of surf boards strapped to the roof. Was this the surf teacher’s mobile teaching wagon? Sure enough, it stopped; out jumped an Aussie surf dude dressed in board shorts and entertaining a thick, white zinc cream on his lower lip. He walked over and questionably shouted “Dave?” I could feel a sense of relief through the haze of grogginess. ’Cool’ I thought as I pulled the side door and entered effortfully into the van. I said hello before squeezing my cheeks between the other surfer wannabes. We headed a short distance further up the beach to an area called North Curl Curl. The area was majestic; the virgin sands and calm waters lapping against the shore added to a sense of paradise. The conditions were, according to the teacher, perfect for a spot of surfing. Unfortunately, there be dragons; more to the point, there be blue bottles (man-o-war jelly fish) sharing the surf area with us. Before grabbing a board and entering the shallows we were shown the basics of surfing on the beach. We were told to

1. Swim through the “breakers” (breaking waves) to get to a spot just beyond.
2. Turn the board so it’s front points towards shore.
3. Look over your shoulder.
4. When the wave approaching you is 5 meters away begin paddling with the hand and arms, don’t stop.
5. If the wave passes underneath the board, hard luck. If you somehow feel the board is moving forwards effortlessly, you’ve fluked it!
6. Now’s the time to think about getting onto your feet, adopt a cobra stance then leap to your feet in one swift action.
7. Try to look cool. If you can ride the wave all the way to shore, you are the dude!

Yep, the basic steps would have worked for me if I had the energy. I don’t think a bottle of original Lucozade would have assisted. I was still drunk from the Christmas Party frivolities. All I could really muster was getting out to a calm spot in the ocean where I could lie down on the board and rest my lethargic body. I had owed at least a days' worth of recovery to my battered shell. During the surfing session, the powerful Aussie sun rays beat down on the surroundings. I was tired, thirsty and in need of sunscreen on all parts of my exposed body. I cleverly managed to cover my head and feet with factor 50. My hands though were completely forgotten. It was clear my paddling apparatus was going to suffer after this surf session. When the surfing teacher called time, I was clearly relieved. I didn’t at any moment have to grapple with a motive blue bottle and I hadn’t broken any bones. Having been appreciatively dropped off at the Queenscliff apartment I wearily made my way to the decompression chamber, my bed, to slowly recover from the effects of alcohol consumption. Water was to become the central theme to much of my recreational life. I developed a passion for snorkelling, it was difficult not to, it was so easy to:1. Access the warm, clear waters of Manly Beach.2. Get ready, chucking a few items of equipment into a bag.3. See colourful wildlife close to a range of nooks and crannies around the rocky bay. Life at the Queenscliff flat was sublime. It was drawing ever closer to Christmas. My half-arsed attempts to find a house share were still not going well. My desperation was starting to show at work; when asked “how ya going?” I tended to drop the shoulders and mention my fickle accommodation shenanigans. The guys in the office were an encouraging, helpful bunch. Elliot was more than happy to assist with temporary digs leading up to the Christmas Break. I had no other options, so appreciatively jumped at the chance. Something else that played on my mind around that time was a young lady that got her details into my mobile phone. Whenever I scanned the few contacts I had, an entry named Elle Morgan-Thomas appeared. I must have done something right during the Christmas party. Well, I cannot solely attribute the success of obtaining a lady’s phone details to my suave and sophisticated pulling technique. No, a certain wing man, with a smile that only a mother could love, helped big time. Bruce, that man with the grimace like smile, the talk and free reign of the company expenses started conversations with many a group of ladies in the night club. His excuse for chatting to the ladies was “this is my mate Dave; he’s just come over from England and is looking to get f*ck*d”. Bruce, bless him, got to the point in few terse terms. Since I did not have many phone numbers in the contacts section of my new iPhone, Elle Morgan Thomas’s stood out. I for many days I milled over contacting her. Every time I looked at my phone and thought about it, I had that “fluttery” feeling in my heart. I closed my eyes, unlocked my phone and sent her a text. The language used was not Shakespearean, it was brief and general, but still, it took me bloody ages to construct. After hitting send, the text consumed my headspace. Was that the correct phone number? I wonder if she remembered me. I wonder what her personality is like. Is she going to reply? if she did not, should I remove her from my contacts? Elle replied almost immediately; to my relief she sent a smiley face emoji and mentioned wing man Bruce, the free drinks and the smooth talking. We used chat about the great man as a Segway to meetup. At that present moment in time I was temporarily located in the Sydney suburb of Annandale in the abode of my sharp-tongued colleague Elliot. Funnily enough, this was where Elle lived too. Cool, there was a restaurant in the main shopping centre named “Made in Italy Annandale” that we agreed to meet at. An evening dinner date; why should I be extremely nervous? Well, when we did talk at the club it was dark, I was “half cooked” and I could not hear anything over the noise of the music. I could not for the life of me remember what she looked like. Why I did use my lovely shiny phone camera to take a snap!?Besides, the photo would have been shocking, given the lack of flash and crap camera tech. As I entered Made in Italy Annandale, I took a good look. I wished someone would stand out as Miss Morgan-Thomas. I walked to all corners of the spacious Mediterranean eatery, but no, nothing. F*ck, was she here and I have stupidly overlooked her? Where is she?! The negative of thoughts of “I’ve been stitched up” began to stew in the thoughts. I calmed down and took a seat, “she could be running late…I’ll give her 10 minutes”. I ordered a bottle of Toohey’s New and nursed it while sporadically looking down at my iPhone. After 5 minutes I received a text, Elle had arrived and wondered where I was. It must have been dark in the Argyle; it seems that both of us didn’t have a clue as to what each other looked like. I glanced into the corners of the restaurant to see who Elle could be. My eyes locked onto one girl sitting by herself, wearing glasses and reading a book. Could this be her? From a distance I absorbed her countenance in more detail. I still did not recognise her. I took a second look around the room. Yep, she was the only woman on her own. It had to be her! I took a swig of Dutch courage and walked slowly towards the prospective dinner date. As I approached, she looked up from her book. With an Aussie upward inflection, I said “Elle?” She smiled, stood up “Dave, right?” I confirmed and gave her a cursory kiss on the cheek. We both sat down and began chatting about the night of the Christmas Party. Elle looked much younger than I expected. I was 30 years old; she was 21. Not too long before leaving the UK for Australia I had dated 22-year-old. Going on a date with a 21-year-old was not too much of a shock. For an Aussie, her skin was soft and untarnished; her complexion was on par with a sun-starved Brit. Conversation flowed somewhat that night, but there was not a connection. We enjoyed our food, kissed and left our relationship at goodbye. I took my hunched body and damaged ego back home to Elliot’s to rest for the night. On approach to Christmas I forgot about the date with Elle. I had my sights set on the upcoming holidays. As was the case across Australia, every employee had to use holiday allowance over the Christmas period. It was a total of 2 weeks; in most cases people extended it. I had no appetite to extend mine, every day working from the office felt like a holiday. I had no idea what I wanted to do over the Christmas holidays. At home I would have been happy staying indoors and away from the harshness of the British wintery weather. Down under I was experiencing the heart of summer. Why stay indoors? Well, maybe to get a blast from the air con, but that was not my style. Being English, if the sun was out, I was out, but with sweaty t-shirt rigidly attached to my body. Holidays… If I were in the UK, I would be looking at summer sun in the Mediterranean. In Australia I could take a “short” 3-hour flight to New Zealand or… travel to Fiji, 4 hours. Why go to the effort of flying out of Australia when I had not experienced much of the great southern continent. What about a road trip? Thanks to David Attenborough all I could picture was the wonderful Great Barrier Reef. If you had given me a map at the time I wouldn’t have a clue where it was located. All I knew, from the conversations I had had, it was somewhere north of Sydney. Given my basic holiday plans I headed to Sydney’s bustling retail centre for talks with a travel agent. “Which travel agency should I visit?” I thought as I walked through an arcade near the large David Jones store. As with many decisions, the first one is usually “THE ONE”. The one in this case was STA Travel. STA Travel, for those who are unfamiliar, is not shabby by any means. It’s not unprofessional by any means. It is basic and budget friendly; perfect for me, with my short arms and deep pockets. As I looked at its brightly lit, cosy interior I was captivated by magazines featuring capitalised words: “EUROPE”, “ASIA” “SOUTH AMERICA”. Where was “AUSTRALIA?” As I turned, I heard the bright, feminine, upward inflection of the travel agent, “can I help?” She looked down at a vacant customer seat. I got the message, take a seat and discuss. I sheepishly greeted before planting my sweaty bum on the synthetic seat surface. She asked me the bloody obvious, which needed to be asked. “Where were you considering of travelling to?” and “Would you be travelling alone?” YES! I had an answer for both of those. “I want to go to the Great Barrier Reef”, “I’ll be travelling alone.” She immediately reached for a magazine and placed it delicately on the desk. “Do you know of Oz Experience?” I looked at her blankly. She continued “It’s a bus that starts in either Cairns or Sydney and finishes in the other city, stopping at various destinations along the way.” “It’s shared accommodation, food is thrown in at some stops. You can stay at any of the stops for as long as you desire. There are several optional side trips too. Up to you to get involved.” I was immersed; the travel agent had described something out of a dream. Me, my own boss, cruising the freeway in a bus travelling to destination this and that. Having the option to stop off for as long as I want… Freedom. “Where do you recommend, I start?” “How long does the bus take to get to the final destination?” The travel agent replied “I recommend starting in Sydney, less busy there. It takes over a week to get to Cairns.” Over a bloody week to get to Cairns! Did I hear her right? Where the bloody hell was Cairns on the brochure map. Looking at the map, travelling distance looked insignificant. When the UK was placed on the same scale map, the penny dropped. Sydney to Cairns by plane took 4.5 hours, a drive covering over 1500 miles. Put into context, the journey is double the length of the UK.I was all set for the Christmas holidays after purchasing my Oz Experience bus ticket. More good news arrived; a room in a flat was available in Manly. Given the distinct lack of competition, I was accepted to move in on my return from the Christmas break. You beauty! I wasn’t going to be alone on Christmas Eve either; Elliot has invited me to his girlfriend’s mom’s church gathering. It was a clear black night, warm, with the feeling of the festive period joviality. 10 of us, Christmas’s orphans, were shoulder-to shoulder sat outside around the long, dining table. Elliot's girlfriend's Mom would play the part of host, tending to our every culinary need. “Would you like some beer David?” I was asked. I looked at the stubby holder, noting the fluid level was below the stubby holder top. I took a swig to better ascertain the spirit level. A swig progressed into a gulp, progressed into an empty bottle. “Yep, another VB would be great thanks.” I replied. VB or Victoria Bitter was the beverage of choice in Australia. I could sense why, given its light, refreshing flavour. I heard many a VB related story; one described a change in the alcohol content of the beer, which resulted in uproar from Bruces and Shelas countrywide. Dare say, the formula of VB has been left untouched since its inception. A cornucopia of alcohol appeared on the dining table, indicating the main food event was to commence. Elliot, his Girlfriend, his Girlfriend’s Mom and Girlfriend’s Mom’s Partner were beavering away with food preparations. Out first were the vegetables: a selection of roasted potatoes, boiled carrots and greens. They were set down gently in the centre. With what seemed like hours, Elliot’s Girlfriend’s Mom returned with a huge silver platter. I looked at Elliot with dismay and asked what type of meat was being served. With his lively eyes and charismatic smile, he said “it’s TurDucken, a deboned chicken stuffed into a deboned duck, stuffed into a deboned turkey!” Why someone would want to do this to three, fine feathered animals were beyond me. Why be dismissive, it may look ugly, but does it taste good? I grabbed the carving knife and fork and began the experience. I placed a roughly cut piece onto my plate and stared at it for a while. It was analogous to delving into an archaeological dig. I was happy what each layer represented. Taking the correct amount of care to transport the layered monstrosity for sampling, while keeping its structural integrity, that was difficult. I skewered the beast with force. With one swift motion it entered my mouth. My focus switched to the flavours and textures of the TurDucken. My expectations were far higher than actual. Disappointingly, it wasn’t a taste sensation. A wise man named Ray from the film Ghostbusters once said, “don’t cross the streams”; applying that to TurDucken, “don’t stuff one bird into another”. Hey, at least I crossed that one off the list. It was never on there prior to this festive occasion. With TurDucken consumed, the table was cleared. More drinks arrived at its centre and quickly disappeared into groups spread out in the four corners of the yard. The social aspect of the night began. I hung around Elliot like a shadow, not knowing Jack from John. Elliot began chatting to an athletic, vacant looking, middle-aged bloke. As I was listening in, I got the feeling that there was more to this man than met the eye. I could see that he was chewing gum like a cow chewed cud. He slowly looked towards me and introduced himself with a Kiwi droll. “Hi, my name is Tom, are you a member of the church?” I shook my head. “Ah okay”, I could see Tom begin to relax. He began to open, relaying the problems he currently faced in his life. Truth be told the church was finding Tom to be a difficult nut to crack. Tom had substance abuse issues; the church had tried hard to kick him from this habit, but he continued, nonetheless. He had good intention, go to church, say his prayers and “stay clean”. However, given his extensive history of “mixing with the wrong people” resulted in missed church visits and relapse. The church had mentioned he was on his last warning. Any more antisocial shenanigans, he was gone. Tom was happy to talk to anyone about his past. He was first and foremost a fighter; a fighter in the blood sport sense of the word. A closer look at his weathered physique confirmed that. As he relayed stories of fights, he illustrated toned-down versions of the fighting techniques he used. I was the person on the receiving end of his dramatised “light shadow boxing”. His fighting techniques were demonstrated in a slow, precise fashion. I was in awe; this bloke was the real deal. I had some idea of fighting techniques, given my exposure to the Japanese martial art Aikido. The techniques Tom used were far more powerful than that of any fighter I had sparred. During our one-sided conversation he dropped in the cursory mention of UFC. For those not aware of UFC, it is a stage where the best mixed martial artists in the world combat. This guy barely standing before me was the first New Zealand entrant into the first ever UFC. The fact he appeared to be punch drunk was testament to his lack of success. He mentioned that he never won a match. He continued to describe his failed relationships outside of fighting, with female partners that gave him a beating. Tom was one of most interesting people I had ever met. You never know who you expect to meet on your travels, especially amongst churchgoers. The next morning Elliot was kind enough to drop me off at the South Sydney hotel, located opposite Sydney Central Train Station. I was encumbered with all my personal wears. After checking in I made my way to the hotel room, opened the door and threw myself onto the bed. It was so nice to have personal space in a relative lap of hotel luxury. I had far too much luggage to take with me on my hols. I hatched a plan there and then to ensure I was going to take just the essentials on this Oz Experience road trip. The plan, cheekily dump my excess luggage at the K.J.Ross & Associates Sydney office and hope it was still there when I got back. With luggage dumped, a slim lined and agile packed me was contemplating the finer things in my life. One of those things I considered fine were the hairs atop my head. An unkempt balding appearance is not good. To alleviate this issue, without any specific hair cutting tools, I decided to use my Gillette razor to see to my hair. What I did not envisage was how much effort was going to be involved. The amount of shaving cream, brute force and time was literally eyewatering. It got done, with a nick here and trickle of blood there. Feeling a freshly shaven head is an unusual sensation. A bald baby’s head feels soft, but the feel of a razor blade shaved head is like clasping a frog. The “skin head” look does have its good side, it has liberalism baked in, a stance I leant towards. The bad side, it is associated with mindless violence; I am as soft as merino wool. I would try to “rock it” to get people to see past its edginess and love the personality, the big softie. A huge benefit of staying at the South Sydney Hotel was it proximity to the Oz Experience’s coach pickup point. First thing in the morning I literally walked out the front door of the hotel and there the coach was. A tall, thin Dutch looking bloke made his presence known as he looked over to me with a piercing glance. He shouted out my name in a deep ocker (stereotypical Aussie) accent. I smiled and walked towards this man with my case in tow. He threw my meagre luggage into the hold and indicated to get on board. The coach was large, enough seats for at least 100 people. It was surprising to find only a handful of people in the coach, all located on the back row of seats. I said an enthusiastic “hello” and sat close by to where they were. I noticed just how young they were. I was 30, not an old traveller by any stretch. I still fell within the age limit for the old school Club 18-30s trips. These tourists were fresh out of college. The one girl was obviously British, petite, big boned, with a southerner’s accent. She had attached herself, in a friendly manner, to a tall 6’ blonde girl sitting beside her. She was German, the same age as the English girl, well-mannered and extremely attractive. Finally, another youngster, older, but still 10years my junior was a chilled out Danish fellow. His skin looked like it had not experienced sunlight in its lifetime. We all started discussing the trip ahead, noting what we were looking forward to. None of us has a clue what the trip entailed other than it started in Sydney and finished in Cairns. We continued to chat as the bus’s engine started up. The air conditioning fired up and off we went. I was the last pickup before the bus was to make its way towards Sydney Harbour Bridge. As we navigated Circular Quay, a noticeable crackling sound was audible over the bus’s speaker system. This sound was followed by a base-y explosion as Jeff, our coach driver and guide, began adjusting his headset. “G’day” he exclaimed; everything Jess said was announced with an exclamation mark much the dismay of the coach’s speaker system. He asked, “how are you guys?”, “looking forward to the journey ahead?” We shouted a loud and resounding “YES!”. Jeff, being so far away from us at the front of the coach could just about hear our reply and down-played how half-hearted our response was. We repeated, but this time with even more vigour. Jeff continued anyway; his dry, terse, Aussie sense of humour came through in droves. He spoke about the Oz Experience; given how fluid the information was relayed to the passengers; it had obviously rehearsed it many times.

- Passenger/coach etiquette.
- On board belongings security.
- Keeping the isles free of items.
- What should and should not be flushed down the loo.

Jeff mentioned some of the optional trips in the itinerary including:

- Byron Bay Surf n Stay
- 1 Night dorm share accommodation.
- 1 x surf lesson Meals (1xBreakfast / 1xDinner)
- Unlimited use of all surfing equipment and wetsuit hire.
- Fraser Island 4WD Tag-a-long Tour
  - 3Days/4Nights 4WD tour, tag-a-long style (2 nights dorm share accommodation) return ferry transfers from Hervey Bay National Park.
- Whitsunday Sailing Tour - 2 Day, 2 Night
  - 2-day, 2-night sailing tour On-board dorm share accommodation
  - All meals (1xBreakfast / 2xLunch / 1xDinner)
  - Snorkel and wetsuit hire Snorkel instruction.
- Magnetic Island 1 Night Stopover
  - 1 Night dorm share accommodation
  - Return ferry transfers from Townsville.
Jeff played a plethora of Aussie songs during the trip including one entitled “Come to Australia”, which summed up all fears that tourists had of Australia. Basically, be warned, you might accidently get killed by spiders, snakes, crocs, sharks, and box jelly fish to name a few of their infamous animals. Jeff used the gamut of Aussie phrases to ensure we were all well versed in the “No worries, no dramas, too easy “culture that Australia presented. The trip was special, my first experience of Australia outside the big city. The Whitsunday Sailing Tour, sailing by the power of the wind, surrounded by the clear, warm, calming waters of the tropics took relaxation to a new level. I was united with many other travellers on the trip. Most tourists I met, weirdly, were from Austria(maybe, Australia was chosen because of its similar name). The main activity that united us was social drinking. Drinking beer is a big part of everyday Aussie life. It is a great excuse to socialise; the Aussies have the British to thank & curse for it. The Aussies have added much to the experience: better weather, colder, more refreshing beer and an insulating bottle blanket named a stubby holder. The day prior to the Oz Experience, I was over in Manly, outside the entrance to a house just off the boulevard. I rang the doorbell and moments later a dishevelled woman with black curly hair and a loose-fitting dress appeared at the door. She spoke with a gravelly French accent, heavily influenced by her smoking habits. She was approaching middle age, and age influenced her physical aroma. Flo was her name, and as her name implied, I had to go with her to check out the room for rent. As I traversed the large, open living space, I entered the room for rent. It had the following positive points:
- High ceiling.
- Free bed.
- En-suite bathroom.
It was dilapidated, but it did not matter, it was better than the alternative i.e., moving across Sydney from one expensive temporary accommodation to the next. Flo tried a sales angle that I had never experienced before. She mentioned that she liked me, as if the thought of being liked by an unattractive person swayed my decision and asked me what I thought. I dismissed the former part of her comment, excusing her for poor English grammar. I said I would be happy to move in if she was happy. There were two ways of travelling to Manly, by land or by sea. The latter is what I was to become accustomed to. Initially, the journey was majestic. The hustle and bustle of people. The elegant, synchronised movement of the ferries and the beautiful sights of Australian icons: The Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House. When it was time to board the ferry, if the weather was good, top and front of deck was where it was at. These seats were full of tourists. I would happily sit inside to obtain a better WIFI signal and “stretch the legs”. The view of the iconic Australian landmarks would ebb as the ferry moved past Woolloomooloo, the fortified Australian Naval Base. The majesty of the journey did not end there. The fun part of the trip began at Sydney Harbour Heads. It was an inhospitable area; the swell on that part of the trip was immense for a sea travelling newbie. It was here that the boat would rock n roll, giving Elvis’s pelvic thrusts a run for their money. The roll of the boat was unprecedented at times, feeling like the it was going to capsize. I slowly got used to this sensation with more experience. When the going got rough, it never ceased to put a smile on my face. Especially seeing the expression on passengers faces, new to the whole experience. The approach to Manly Wharf was a memorable one because of the tall pines, the bustling promenade, and the German Beer Café. The pedestrianised promenade appeared in full view as I disembarked. It had that beach town feel, as and smothered the walkways and the sound of the sea breeze echoed in the trees. I could not believe such a culturally different town existed so close to the city. I arrived back outside the Manly house-share accommodation with all my possessions, most of which I had retrieved from the Sydney work office space across the harbour. Flo, the acting landlady, was there to show me around the new digs and to my vacant room. Flo, late for work, made her apologies beknown. I sat down heavily on the unadorned mattress shouldering my luggage. Unfortunately, the bed’s structure was compromised, which saw me comedically fall straight through it. Embarrassingly I gathered myself back to my feet, placed my items down slowly and looked under the bed. I could see the problem. Originally there had been at least 10 wooden beams to the mattress support. There now existed 7; at least I had knowledge of where I should place my body in future. Not at the end of the bed was the answer. House sharing was new to me. Prior to the current living arrangements in Manly I had lived alone in a town house and with my family at their large detached home. I did not have a clue what the protocol was for shared accommodation. What was my role in the house? What was the shared space? What rights did I have? My plan was to play it by ear and react to anything that felt amiss. And amiss was the best way to describe the interior décor of the property. The best way to describe it was a dishevelled Australian construct fused with a smoke-y French flamboyance. The flavour was hugely influenced by the acting landlady Flo. Flo was a 40 something French cook. If she were a cheese, she would be a Bleu d’Auvergne, strong in flavour, but nothing to look at. The shoulder length black, wavy hair, baggy dress and gravelly French accent gave her an unmistakeable presence. She moved with a grace and veracity that contradicted such an appearance. She loved her cats, all 4 of them. As a general life rule a cat owner with any more than 1cat should have their sanity assessed. The cats did what they wanted, which suited Flo’s libertarian philosophy. This caused an issue to housemates, but not bother Flo. The cats took a poo wherever they pleased. The cats slept all day given their available, protein rich diet. What goes in, must come out; for the largest of the cats it did daily. The place it frequented was the main bathroom that was shared by Flo and Tom (the other flat mate). Flo would usually clean up before Tom used the bathroom first thing in the morning, but there were several occasions when Flo was too late to act. Tom, on entering the bathroom, would let the household know about the issue by screaming “Flo!” at the top of his lungs. Tom was in his late 20s, a dishevelled looking festival goer, hailing from the North of England. When he was not finding cat shit in the main bathroom, he was found in his room. Their he smoked copious quantities of marijuana and drank Toohey’s New in his “beauty is in the eye of the beer holder” stubby holder. He spoke with an eloquence that contradicted his outward appearance. Tom was well educated and a season traveller. He loved Top Gear, that, beer, and England, bonded us. Each chat would usually centre about the awful state of the flat, and those bloody cats! He had no job and no real direction in life. He was behind on his rental payments and constantly talking about his exit strategy from the flat. I had no issues with Tom, I respected his point of view, which was much in contrast with Flo’s. Flo, as I was to find out was going to be the bane of my life too. The only words she had to say to me were of complaint. She complained that I did little around the house and that I should contribute more to chores. Back then I worked on the principle of “what only I use, I clean, what we share, you take care of”, which did not lend itself well to the whole house-SHARE concept. I hated confrontation seeking to avoid her wrath if possible. Unfortunately, it meant any constructive communications between us were few and far between. Thankfully, the flat was vacant most of the times I returned from work, thanks to Flo having to chef in the evenings at the pub across the promenade, the Ivanhoe Hotel. There was the odd time when I passed by Tom’s ajar bedroom door where a chink of light pierced the darkened hallway. If that angelic outline was there, which it usually was, I knew Tom was out, which he was most of the time. Strange, given he had no job, little money, and a full fridge shelf of Toohey’s New. Tom had copious amounts of beer on his assigned shelf in the fridge. A regular at a local pub once said “man can live on beer alone”; Tom was testament to this. I did not keep much in the fridge, I preferred to purchase my food from the local supermarket and slap it onto a plate when I got home. The Coles’ pre-cooked ½ chicken with a side of lettuce & tomatoes was my idea of dinner. The chicken was extremely greasy and as salty as a dead dingo’s donger. When I opened the chicken’s plastic-lined paper bag, the grease would flood out and form a grease puddle on the plate. I always set aside a knife and fork, which I never used. Eating chicken on the carcass, for me, was performed with the hands, teeth and sleeves. My upbringing had shaped my eating behaviour. I never left the table without finishing my food. With that mentality, I ensured that nothing, but the inedible bits of the chicken remained. After emptying the remains of the chicken into the swollen bin, I would consume Queensland’s summer seasonal speciality dessert, the mango. The mangos were yellow and enormous; consuming the sweet, sticky fruit, trying to stop its nectar from running down the arms took a coordinated effort. The stickiness of the mango juice and the grease of the Coles cooked chicken meant for a messy, but pleasurably cheap meal. My post meal-time timetable was well structured:1. Take 2 steps to the bedroom.2. Lie on bed.3. Fire up laptop and binge watch an American TV show. The room was large, high-ceilinged, with little furniture. The ruffled bed and chest of drawers were left by the previous occupants. A large walk-in-wardrobe was accessible as well as a shared bathroom. Unfortunately, with little applied TLC, it was left in a state fit for stoners, junkies and me (people desperate for a house share).The view from my room lacking. Given I lived 2 blocks away from Manly Beach, the only sea-front feature I could make sense of was the tops of Manly Beach’s fern trees. A glance directly below the bedroom window revealed many industrial sized garbage bins. It was the height of summer, with the bedroom lacking adequate air conditioning the window needed to be opened. If the noisome smell did not impact you, then the cockroaches that scaled the walls would. Being from the UK, my contact with creepy crawlies at night was minimal. The Australian environment introduced a raft of new animals. On particularly humid nights I questioned the window, “how ajar is enough for comfort and enough to keep the beasts at bay”. One night I was asleep with windows wide-open. I tossed and turned; the humidity was discomforting. As I lay there in a foetal position I felt something scurry across my feet. I was tired and dismissive about what it could be, so I ignored the sensation. Whatever it was, hopefully the encounter was a fleeting one. I quickly settled back into sleep mode. A few seconds passed; the sensation of something crawling up my leg caused me to kick out forcefully. My heart raced, I sat bolt upright and reached for the bed side light switch. It was on the wall, and it saw me. The cockroach, a monster arthropod, was lying in wait for my next move. Given its immense size, had experience on its side. I’m sure it had many encounters with people in its long life. I could sense it was mocking me; beckoning me to make the next move. I stood there, clad only in boxer shorts. I reached for my bedside flip-flop (thong) ready to thrash the beast. I ran towards the wall and swung my flip flop into the space that once was occupied by the cockroach. The new space it occupied was a good 5 metres away. I again ran towards the cockroach, slapping an empty space. This melee continued for 5 minutes. I placed my hands on my hips, breathing laboured, with flip-flop clasped loosely in my right hand. I shook my head; my plan of attack needed adjusting. I waited for a moment of inspiration that never arrived. I had one simple thought, if at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. I was wrong, if you repeat the same actions, you’re going to get the same outcomes. In my case, failure to kill the cockroach. As my tired mind began accepting defeat, the deft cockroach finally thought better than to stay in an unwelcoming environment and buggered off back out the window. I slumped in back in my bed. I had one eye open and gripped my pillow tight that night. When I woke up on the weekends, usually worse for wear after a night of social drinking, I would often walk from my room into the kitchen. Enjoying breakfast was a simple matter of grabbing a bowl, spoon,2 Weetbix biscuits, milk and a spot at the breakfast table. For variety’s sake I would sometimes eat in the balcony area located just off the living room. The balcony faced out onto the side street below. Its concrete floor was awash with used cigarettes and pots of sand. It was, for the most part, Flo’s cheeky smoking hideaway. Unfortunately, the smoke would carry in through the door that connected the balcony to the lounge, leaving a stale tobacco smell throughout the whole apartment. I would sometimes take my breakfast over to the lounge sofa and turn on the TV. It was there that one day, wearing only my boxer shorts, I felt something crawl on my skin. This time it was a different, more subtle sensation. But it stopped me in my tracks. I looked closer at my legs. Initially I couldn’t see it. I studied my leg acutely. The only carpeted room in the house was the lounge. My brain began to piece together the puzzle. Where did Flo’s collection of cats often reside? Yep, the lounge. What was on my leg? A family of fleas. I made a mental note, adding the following list of questions to ask prior to renting a room:1. How many cats do you have? If the landlady replies with a number greater than 1, run away!2. Given you have failed to take your own advice to question 1, next question should be “where do your cats do their business?” If the answer is not “outside” or “in a kitty litter tray”, check your watch, look flustered and run!3. Given desperation & stupidity, follow up the prior 2 questions with “do carpet fleas trouble you? “I could now see the haze that thrived in the lounge, a haze of fleas. The only respite from the swarm was the settee, an island surrounded by carpet. I felt unclean… I had to get out of there and return to my quarters, doing so with a hop, skip and jump. That was the last straw. I didn’t want to be there anymore. I had to find a new place. I felt lonely; my best mates in Sydney were Bruce “the K.J.Ross Consultancy Services Salesman ”Rawsthorne, Tom “The Vagabond Flatmate” Price and Flo’s “Flea Circus “cats. All were busy over the Christmas period. The latter were shut away in the cat toilet, waiting for Tom’s return. I sat in bed and thought about the date of romance I had prior to Christmas. As uneventful as the encounter was, there was a small spark that glimmered away in the recesses of my heart. I had a thought, ‘I wonder what she’s up to?’ ‘Would I be stupid to send her a short message?’ ‘I’ve got tails of my recent holiday adventure to tell.’ With that thought, the iPhone was out, and the texting fingers quickly worked their magic, crafting the follow-up text. The text read “Hi Elle, hope you are well? I’ve recently returned from my Sydney to Cairns, East Coast Trip. I really enjoyed meeting you before the Christmas Break. It would be great to see you again. Dave” Short, sweet, simple, sent. I waited for the bait to be taken. I lay the phone down and tried to sleep; sleep was light as my heart and thoughts raced. I was ready to pounce at the phone, if by chance, she replied. I waited… and waited… I got restless, got up and began cleaning the room. I glanced occasionally over at my phone. I looked at it, willing it to make a sweet apple iPhone notification sound. “Come on phone, do something!” I repetitively walked over to check, nothing. “Elle, why? Why don’t you respond?” I checked the time; 2 minutes had passed. I felt suicidal. Anger took hold at this point, the f-ing and blinding turned the air blue. “F*ck it, I didn’t like you anyway…!”, I said loudly. At that moment, the phone buzzed. I leapt onto it like a peregrine falcon snatching an unexpecting pigeon. My heart raced, I looked away. It was difficult to bring myself to reading the reply. A plethora of ‘What ifs…?’ filled my mind. I tried to second guess what the text could be. I unlocked the phone, opened one eye and cautiously read the first sentence. “Hey Dave, it was good to meet you too…”. It felt like passing an exam I thought I had failed. I leapt from my bed, punched the air with joy and shouted “YES, YES, YES!” I was happy to leave my thoughts there but remembered there were several sentences still to read. I tentatively returned to look at the text. “It would be great to hear more about your trip. I’m busy with studies over the next couple of days, I’m free Saturday evening? Elle x.” Was that a kiss crafted at the end of the sentence. She loves me, she really loves me! Bloody hell. I wanted to reply immediately, but there was a chance she would sense my desperation and ignore me. I had to be cool; breathe, wait, think, text! I made my desperation wait 5 minutes and began crafting my next response, which I was able to with little editing. “Sounds great. I’m currently living over in Manly. Happy to head your way if its more convenient. Let’s meet at a bar over at Circular Quay, how does 7:00pm sound?” It felt like interviewing for a new job. I had passed the 1st dating stage and was happily progressing to stage 2. I pondered my chances of winning this opportunity. I had little relationship experience prior to meeting Elle. I find it difficult to remember the women I dated; odd, given I had only dated 2. Of those relationships, it was Sam, a girl I met through dating website OkCupid, that stood out. At the time, I was 29, Sam was 27; we both lived in Lichfield. Other commonalities included: Facebook, drinking & humour (our first date was at a comedy club). If I was being pedantic, I could add existing to that list. She was gorgeous. She was brilliant at social media, but crap at the face-to-face human interactions. A pity, we ended the relationship via Facebook, with me ranting about her inability to make the time to meet me in person. In my late 20s, early 30s I was questioning the norms, reading life altering books by authors like Jared Diamond. It dawned on me what success meant; from an animalistic perspective I made it a goal to have kids. I believed I needed a woman in my life to achieve that goal. Embarrassingly, I had a problem, and would later find out much to my embarrassment, that I lacked a sex drive. When I look back into my earliest memories of sex, it all seems a bit odd. Before I reached 10 years of age, I got an unexplainable pleasure from sliding down metal poles. I remember my first erection; I was watching the weekly, music TV show “top of the pops”. The sight of an 80s Italian pop star and model overwhelmed my senses. As a young teen going through puberty, I was getting an erection hourly. My penis would stand to attention during the car journey to school, during every class I attended and, on the walk, home. I never doubted my sexuality; I had a socially acceptable attraction to females. I loved large breasts; arguably I was obsessed with that child-rearing feature. It confirmed a theory, I found women who were shaped and looked like my mother, attractive. As a child, teenager, and young adult I never thought of my mom as being attractive. Women that were the younger spitting image of her, however, I did. At school, I understood men, I grew up with 2 brothers. My dad was my idol. I treated women with social distancing. I was shy, I didn’t understand them and didn’t have the courage to bridge the social gap. When I got home from school, I masturbated to mental images of curvy women from class. It became a habit; later with the introduction of the internet, it became extremely easy to continue. I didn’t realise what impact this obsession was having on my mental health. When I was legally allowed to drink alcohol, I believed I couldn’t socialise with women without being drunk. I had a problem with treating women as human beings. My interactions with women would become healthier after I entered my first job as a shop assistant at WHSmith. Men were in the minority; I was able to interact with many women as a result, which improved my social health no end. I had to play a serious amount of catch up. Slowly I gained an appreciation for women as human beings, but work did little to stop me masturbating in my room at home. In my 20s my sexuality matured. I brainwashed myself. I believed I was heterosexual. How could a person, like me, not be heterosexual if I masturbated to images of women? But I felt an attraction to men. I could not deny that feeling. Did I want to explore that desire sexually? No, it made me feel uncomfortable. With all males that I got along with and found attractive, I only wanted friendship. I questioned if I was gay, straight, bi-sexual, null or void? Googles answer id great, “you are not alone in questioning your sexual orientation”. I appreciated the female form. I was comfortable with the thought of having sexual intercourse with women. However, as I later found out with Elle, I did not have the libido to have sex with any woman. For years I was sexually aroused by pornographic images of large breasted women. I later discovered I was aroused by pictures of large penises. Why did large sexual organs arouse me? Subconsciously, it was dominance. I found people of power attractive. Pornography portrayed people with large sexual organs as the ones with that power. I have imposed mental restrictions; I don’t want to have sex with men. Conversely, if a woman does not have “powerful” bodily features i.e., large breasts and a curvaceous form, I will not find her attractive. I had very little sexual experience prior to meeting Elle. I had “successfully” intercourse with two females, both prostitutes in foreign countries, when I was in my 20s. I failed on 2 other, more recent, occasions, a work mate and a friend of a friend. Subconsciously, this concerned me. I arrived at Circular Quay, having spent the best part of half an hour commuting across the Sydney Harbour Head. As I walked across the square, I felt nervous. Should I bail? I was showered and smartly dressed. I cared for this occasion. Elle chose the meet up point, an easy to locate pub with outside seating. I racked my brain as to what she looked like (it had been over a month since I last saw her). The memory of her in the dark and dingy Italian restaurant had faded significantly. Was she attractive? What did we talk about? I had a back-up plan; if the chat didn’t flow, I would talk about my recent holiday. Was that going to impress her? I felt pessimistic; was this going to be our last date? As I approached the pub’s outdoor seating area, I instantly recognised her. Thankfully, she was the only l one white female. She looked prettier than I remembered. I watched her glance to her right, taking a vacant look into the bright space of the harbour. I nervously approached her table, smiled and tried to get her eyes to meet mine. Her face lit up, a smile beaming across it. She got out of her seat and gave me a hug with the warmth one would give to an old acquaintance. I was happy and surprised to begreeted in this fashion. We both sat down at opposite ends of the 4-seater, medium sized table. I looked at Elle’s half full glass of cordial and asked if she wanted another drink. She took a sip through a straw and nodded, releasing her lips from the straw opening. “Yeah, okay, lemon and lime cordial please. I need to study hard tomorrow, can’t drink tonight” she said. “Right, lemon and lime cordial” I repeated. I entered the bar and looked at the blackboard behind the bar attendant. The sign read “Mondays-Thursdays, 6-8pm,$4 schooners of VB”. There was another sign beside that, “Mondays-Thursdays, 6-8pm, Steak and Chips for $10”. I made a mental note of the latter for a future dinner choice. The former was an offer I couldn’t refuse. I’m sure Elle chose the venue to suit her student monetary needs. I couldn’t complain, it suited my cheap-as-chips, but high-quality, mantra. I returned to our table outside with drinks in hand, ready to bring my holiday stories to life. Not being a person to drive conversation, it was Ella that spoke first. She asked, in a caring fashion synonymous with Australians, “how are you?”. This question was quickly followed with another, “what was your holiday like?”. I had forgotten I had texted her during the holiday about my shenanigans. I found Elle’s ability to confidently drive the conversation very attractive. Looking at her captivating eyes and smiley face, she looked cute too. I replied, “I’m good and the holiday was brill, cheers for asking.” I began to elaborate on the holiday experience. I mentioned I had visited the largest sand island in the world, “Frasier Island”. She corrected my phonetics “it’s Fray-ser Island, not Fray-z-your island.” In true English fashion I apologies then enthusiastically relayed excerpts from my Fraser Island story including: “The bus driver drove this close to the trees.” “The bi-plane pilot didn’t even bother looking out the window.” The captivated look on Elle’s face showed signs of positivity. Time had flown by; Elle was looking at her watch signalling that she had to get back home to finish her studies. I looked at my empty glass of beer and happily called a break on precedents. I kissed her goodnight and began walking back to the Manly ferry, chest out and head held high. I felt confident I would see her for date number 3.Over the next weeks my relationship with Elle began to develop and so did the frequency and size of our mobile phone texts. My phone was in constant use. This wasn’t so bad outside of work. I didn’t have a great deal going on in my life other than dedicating time to Cole’s supermarket cooked chicken section. However, in work I was being distracted, context switching more often. Writing computer code is mentally taxing. Having the consolatory iPhone buzz and _DING_ all day resulted in my productivity “going down the gurgler”. My manager, Daniel, would pop into my section to mock me and my phone alerts. Dan could initiate a personal conversation e.g., is that your lady friend texting you. He was good at exposing a flaw in your response. Any response would be met with banter, he’d then switch to manager mode in a couple of sentences. He often complained to his boss that we were not being productive. My thoughts at the time were “well, Mr Allam if you stopped f*ck*ng distracting us, and if my phone didn't send notifications every 2 minutes, we’d be more likely to meet your deadlines”. It was easy to bond with Dan. He came from a middle-class family upbringing in the south of England. We did share a similar sense of humour, a love for the outdoors and heavy metal music. He was a rocker in a business suit, but without the associated aesthetics. During our lunch break we, David Playford, Dan and I, would follow Dan’s lead. Dave Playford and I were new to Sydney. Dan would take us to various food courts and retail establishments. He loved visiting Allans Music + Billy Hyde located on the High street. Dan had a penchant for the handmade, Australian Maton acoustic guitar. I favoured the electric varieties, especially the Gibson range. Dan tried his best to find a Maton that wasn’t firmly secured to the wall. He'd grab a stool and begin strumming a soft metal medley. He was transfixed playing the guitar, so much so I felt I was invading his personal space. When he was in that zen state, I would find a guitar of my own. However, I never quite got to the same state of flow that Mr Allam had attained. As I placed a cheap looking Fender Stratocaster on the thigh of my right leg I began communicating with it by playing my rendition of The Animals classic “House of Rising Sun”. The guitar sounded awful; it was so out of tune that it sounded more like a bass than a lead. Unfortunately, I did not have the ear required to tune the instrument manually. A guitar tuner was required for such a job. I tried my best to tighten the guitar strings so it would produce a sound familiar to the ears of a tone-deaf roadie. As I began to play without an amp, I felt the presence of Johnny Marr (the lead guitarist of band The Smiths).I could sense the presence of the legend. His ghostly image looked at me and said in a broad Mancunian accent “put that guitar down and leave now, you’ve murdered that tune. ”Dan removed himself from the ebb and flow of the Maton’s heart strings. He walked over to me as I switched to my 2nd and final song for the session, “The Sultans of Swing” by band Dire Straits. It was the first guitar tablature I had religiously self-taught. It had been a while since I played it. Like a phoenix from the flames, my fingers placed themselves reassuringly on the correct strings and frets. As I plucked away, the spirit of Mark Knopfler (the lead guitarist) took over and the rest of the performance owed itself to a huge dose of muscle memory. The rendition did nothing to doff the cap to the musical artistry of Knopfler; It was more a gentle nod. Dan appreciated my rendition. He began talking with the ebb and flow of his husky, base-y tone “Mr Clarke… and the Sultans of Swing. Lovely.” I was happy it received his appreciation. I was beginning to spend more time with Elle. When we weren’t together, we texted. Sometimes it was idle chit chat, other times it was borderline sex chat. We even visited the cinema together. At the time3D was seeing a resurgence on the big screen and home entertainment units. One evening after work, we visited the Hoyts cinema in Sydney City Centre. The film of the moment was a production called Avatar; its plot was written in the same style as epic adventures including the Matrix and Star Wars. It was a 3D film, which unfortunately forced us to wear 3D Glasses. It was doubly frustrating for four-eyed me, who had to wear the 3D glasses above my ordinary spectacles. It was a great film to take a date to; It had moments of love, sadness and euphoria. Elle and I, up until this point in our dating history, had only kissed each other at the end of the previous date. Time spent sitting together in the cinema allowed a chance to take the next steps. I slowly reached out to hold her hand, which was met with reciprocation. We turned and tried to kiss each other, but the 3D glasses stopped our lips from touching. We smiled, removed the glasses and began to smooch. Elle enthusiastically asked me to follow her lead. She wanted to reproduce the 101 Dalmatians film kissing moment. We didn’t have spaghetti, so we tried the scene with popcorn to a degree of success. The whole being together felt heart-warming, even more so considering one of the greatest films of the 21st Century. A bout of texts between me and Elle resulted in dinner invitation at her student flat in Annandale. “Excellent” I thought, but I was ill prepared for such a venture. This was the first time I had been invited to a female friend’s home. When I finished work, I headed to the main bus stop located at Circular Quay. Thankfully, according to my iPhone, only one bus was required to get me within walking distance of Elle’s home. Not being completely entrusted in technology I did ask a bus driver, who confirmed the route was correct. The bus journey was slow. I gathered my thoughts about the upcoming meal. What, other than the meal, did Elle have in mind? How should I behave? Should I have a plan of action? Never mind those thoughts, when I exited the bus all I could think about was how do I get to her house? Thankfully Elle provided succinct directions. After ascending a flight of stairs, I found the front door, I knocked. It took a short time before it flung open and a welcoming figure appeared. Elle stud there with arms wide open and a smile on her face. “Dave!” she exclaimed, with enough enthusiasm to fill a village hall. I warmly embraced and kissed her. As we released our embrace, I immediately noticed her sense of disappointment. Being a forthcoming person, she said “Where is my gift? You don’t just turn up someone’s house, when they’re offering you food, and not bring along a gift for the host!” I did what British people do best, humbly apologise and look sheepish. She returned a forgiving glance, smiled, hugged me again before skipping jovially to the kitchen. “I hope you like pasta, tomato and basil?” she shouted. I replied, “I’m not a fussy eater by any stretch.” I had survived my mother’s poor-quality cooking for 25 years. Elle was a student; by student’s standards she lived well. The apartment was humble but included everything a person required to live in comfort. As I walked through the hallway, I was met with the kitchen area, cooker was on the right, dining table centre and bathroom just off to the left. Beyond the dining room table lay her high double bed with shelves surrounding it. The bedside window let much needed light into the apartment, penetrating as far as the dining table. My bladder, as usual, requiring immediate attention, followed swiftly by my suit jacket. It was damp with sweat thanks to Sydney’s summer humidity. I tucked my ruffled shirt in and asked Elle for directions to her bathroom. I was slowly adopting the Australianised word for toilet, bathroom. Thankfully, the Aussies did keep some British versions of words close to their hearts: mate, jumper, mobile phone. I loved the Australian version of the word duvet, doona. l returned from the bathroom and asked Elle if I could have a look around her home as she prepared food. She happily obliged. It didn’t take long to absorb its every detail, given its small size. One group of items that were distinctive, were her books on politics. She was obviously studying this subject. By the sheer quantity of references books I assumed she knew the subject well. She began serving dinner, placing the pots of food on the worktop near the gas hobs. I was elated to see the pasta dish, served with much care and love. Elle loved food and it showed in the way it was presented. Elle placed the dishes and cutlery on the dining table place mats. She walked over to her music player and pressed the play button and made a beeline for the bathroom. The music grabbed my attention immediately. The tracks were all modern & melodic, but I didn’t recognise any tune. As Elle returned, I asked which bands were playing? She smiled and said she had created a special playlist just for me. Artists such as: Sneaky Sound System, The Temper Trap, Powder Finger and The Cat Empire were just some of the bands represented. I smiled as I wolfed down the pasta dish. Elle ignored my unusual eating habits. With eyes widened, a trivia question arrived on her lips. “Do you know what the tracks I’ve played have in common?” she exclaimed. My focus was still on the sumptuous food as I slurped the remainder of the bolognaise sauce. I shook my head. I knew the modern music scene in the UK well. I did know that they weren’t “big” bands on the international western stage. Elle bubbled with joy as she blurted out the answer, “Australian! All the bands you’ve heard on the playlist are Australian!!”. I contemplated responding with “good on ya”. Unfortunately, I didn't fully understand what that phrase meant. She rushed over to the fridge and brought back a packet of confectionary goods that looked somewhat like British McVities Penguin chocolate biscuits. “Hey Dave, have you ever tried Tim Tams? More importantly, have you ever tried caramel Tim Tams?” she jovially asked. My dumbfounded expression gave answer to that. She handed me the packet to take a closer look. My gut instinct was correct, the creators of Tim Tam had plagiarised McVities Penguin and repackaged them. I unwrapped one and began eating; the endorphin rush began, one crumbly, sweet Tim Tam, became two, became three. I was lost in the moment; thankfully Elle grabbed my attention and asked me to sit with her on the edge of her high, double bed. Elle looked at me, her eyes glistening, her smile radiant. She was cute, her skin looked so tender. I could see her focus shift from my eyes to my chin as she edged closer. I delicately reached out to feel how soft her face was. Our mouths touched. As I continued to kiss her, Elle used her body to direct my senses. The kissing became more passionate; my arousal levels began to soar. She instructed me to kiss an area at the back of her left ear. On doing so she began to groan with pleasure. The sound was enthralling, spurring me to continue. After minutes of foreplay, I stopped to catch my breath. We stared at each other fondly; Elle broke the silence, “I get really horny when I get kissed on the neck… I will really want to fuck you if you continue to do that.” She smiled again; I looked at her with a contradicting seriousness demeanour. I leaned in and kissed her on the neck; We began to shed our clothes. I made sure my work clothes were well organised on the floor. I had to look smart for work the next morning. I kissed Elle from neck to toe, spending a lot of time appreciating her breasts. This was the first time I had experienced foreplay without the influence of Alcohol. It was more stimulating than any previous sex I had had. However, I wasn’t stimulated enough to have sex. I continued, kissing her vagina, using my tongue to flick the labia. Elle’s sounds of pleasure increased in pitch and volume. She shouted, “fuck me!” At that moment I sensed my penis was not fully erect. Any amount of self-stimulation was not working. I panicked, improvising, I began to penetrate her vagina with my fingers, and continued to lick her labia. Elle screamed with pleasure; it wasn’t long before my right arm began to tire. The left arm was tagged to assist. Given the lack of air conditioning and humid conditions, I was beginning to dehydrate. Elle could sense my frustration. We slowed proceedings and sat together on the side of the bed. She began rubbing my semi-erect penis, sucking it with a combination of tongue, teeth and lips. The sensation was somewhat dulled, given the lack of sensory receptors on the penis. My penis, for a moment, became fully erect. Elle excitedly reached for a condom and attempted to place it on my penis. My penis began to return to its flaccid state. After multiple attempts of oral stimulation, with penis semi-erect, I ejaculated. The sex stopped, I looked apologetic, then I lay next to her. Elle offered words of consolidation. We were both tired, enjoying the final moments of our embrace. During the night I was happy to kiss her body. She had such beautiful skin that, like a moth to a light, I couldn’t help but be attracted to it. I got little sleep given the humidity and my unusual sleeping position. When Elle’s alarm rang first thing in the morning, I couldn’t muster the strength to get up. I lay in bed as Elle readied herself for the day. I slept with one eye open to get a glimpse of her as she got dressed. Last night she had worn contact lenses. This morning she was wearing glasses. They suited her, signifying her intellect. I could see she was focused on her routine. It took me great effort to release my body from the soft mattress but tried I did. My work clothes were strewn across the floor, not at all fashioned for the daily grind at E*Trade. Given the time, I had no time to shower. I applied the crumpled garments to my body, yawned and looked sheepishly over at Elle. She looked frugal, ready to take on the day. I looked ready to take on more sleep. Thanks to Elle’s influential energy I felt compelled to follow take her lead as she exited the flat. She pointed in the direction of her university, turned 180degrees and pointed at the city. “Dave, you that way, me this way. Catch the 470 bus on this side of the road.” I lifted my head to give her one last kiss before saying goodbye. As she walked away, I saw the bus approach. I managed to flag it down, hop on board and grab a seat as close to the front as possible. I felt paranoid, it must have been obvious to other passengers why I looked in such a dishevelled state. I just wanted to sleep. Unfortunately, there wasn’t a bed on-board. I did manage to use deodorant that morning. The smell of the deodorant hopefully would disguise any whiff of sex that was present on me. I was happy my bag was light, by laptop bag standards. My laptop was a key tool I for client engagements. It kept me in touch with the consultancy. Much like a Batman symbol shining on the clouds, it gave me access to assistance to do battle. I wish I could have used it there and then to rescue me from a day at E*Trade. I slumped in the bus seat, occasionally looking out of the window to see my ghostly image staring back at me. I closed my eyes briefly only for my thoughts to be consumed by what the day ahead had in store for me. Unfortunately, it was bad news. I realised that today there was going to be a presentation. I was going to be one third of its creative output. This didn’t faze me; what did, was the thought of facing Dan Allam. The English joker was going to have a field day when I rolled into work, late. As I approached my work desk, I unglued the backpack from my moist back. I placed it on one of the many chairs that were strewn around the segregated testers lab area. I took the laptop out of the bag and placed it gently onto the desk surface. I could pick out the faint sound of footsteps. Unsurprisingly, Dan pop his head in with a not too happy look on his face. I hadn’t seen the serious side to Dan “the joker” Allam. Bring back the slapstick joker, my mind cried. Dan took a good look at me. His seriousness slowly crumbled, replaced with a wide beaming smile. His demeanour reflected a fox that had taken all the chickens from the hen house. His voice was slow, and tone deep, “so Mr Clarke, was Mrs Clarke any good last night?” He opened his mouth, extended his tongue and began simulating licking a lollipop. I looked at him with a smug smile on my face, “she was alright” I said. I continued “I gave her 3 inches of English Cumberland Sausage that I’m sure she’ll order again. “It was a memorable day if Elliot was part of it. Today was his first time visit to E*Trade. His focus is and forever will be, money. He had the art of self-presentation mastered. He always looked the part when arriving on client site. His slim, 6’2” stature, boyish looks purveyed a trustworthy, respectful appearance. He made sure his formal attire was iron board smooth, hair gelled, filo-fax shining and his smile switched-on. Elliot exited the lift to meet me in the hallway, he shook my hand, smiled and immediately asked for the location of Srikanth’s office. Srikanth, a man of Indian descent and head of IT, was the man that held the purse strings. Elliot wanted to ensure he spent most of the morning loosening those purse strings. As Elliot saw Srikanth his smile beamed, “You must be Srikanth, I’m Elliot Caldwell, K.J.Ross &Associates”. I returned to my desk in the lab and looked at the presentation. I looked at the template that Elliot had sent over the night before. Dave Playford and I had butchered it using technical data from various sources. Elliot had tainted it further with K.J.Ross financial data under the heading “savings after test automation”. The PowerPoint presentation was bullshit. Its aim was solely to impress the key fund holder, Srikanth. Up until that point, me and Dave Playford had achieved very little. We created a couple of sketchy automation proof of concepts that worked with a lot of manual intervention. No way did we have a gold standard solution. The result of me and Dave efforts would hopefully allow K.J.Ross to deliver something that would look, from the correct viewing angle, like the real deal. We just needed Elliot to make sure he was well versed. Before the presentation was finalised, Elliot, having finished his meeting with Srikanth, popped over to see me and Dave Playford with Mr Allam in tow. Elliot’s smile still beamed. The glint in his eyes indicated either he was going to make love to us or make money by using us. Thanks god it was latter. I was too tired to get screwed again in the space of 12 hours. Dan left Dave, Elliot and I to the secrecy of the Test Lab. Elliot’s eyes darted around the enclosed space, to pick out anything that looked like recording device. He quickly looked at me, then Dave Playford and said, “did you get to look at the presentation template that I sent over?” Dave and I looked at each other, nodded, looked at Elliot and simultaneously said “yep!” "Well, can I have a look at it”, he demanded. Elliot took one look at his wristwatch. He told us the presentation of our proof of concept had been scheduled for 11:00. The time was now 9:00am; we still had time to polish this presentation. Elliot immediately took charge. He began to swiftly delegate parts of the presentation to me and Dave. He pasted in a couple of standard slides around cost savings. It was decided that Elliot would do most of the talking. Dave and I would step up when it was time to perform a demonstration. We cleverly selected an automated test that had a 50/50 chance of running without our assistance. It was 10:45, we were ready. My laptop was under my arm as we approached the meeting room. The atmosphere felt wild west. We, the outlaws, were walking into a saloon full of unsavoury characters. We meant business, flashing a view of our weapon, the laptop, as we approached the table. Hopefully the audience wasn’t going to take a pot shot at us. Elliot looked at me and Dave nervously. He had a high-level appreciation of what we sent here to do, but technically he had no idea. Dave Playford and I were on hand to assist answering anything technical. As soon as I got the projector working, I used the laptop to fire up the presentation. I gave Elliot the nod. He took the baton like a well-versed relay runner. He looked up at the audience, walked to the front of the stage, adjusted his tie and smiled. His stature commanded everyone’s attention; the bustle of the room distilled into silence. He looked at me and nodded, indicating he would like to see the first slide. “G’day" he said impactfully. Throughout the presentation Elliot used simple phrases. His pitch, volume and pace indicated confidence. As I proceeded clicking through the slides, Elliot’s tempo increased. The smile on his face widened when the financial benefits slide appeared. It was obvious this slide, his only contribution to the slide pack, was where his focus lay. His eyes lit up. When the presentation finished, Dan and Srikanth looked at each other in an agreeable, accommodating fashion. Elliot had, as Baseball fans would describe it, “knocked the ball out the park”. He knew he’d managed to send the correct message to Srikanth and was now looking at the next phase to loosen those purse strings further, the Scope of Work document. As good as Elliot was at sales it was Bruce, Head of Sales and Marketing in Sydney, that wrote the statement of work. It wasn’t a difficult task: download the K.J.Ross & Associates document template, cut, paste, done. It was going to be weeks before the document would be signed by E*Trade. There was lots of red tape to get through. What were Dave Playford and I to do in the interim? Return to the office bench. The bench in a consultancy was much like that of a sports team bench. The only difference, your whole team could be on the bench while the game played. There was always work out there to tender i.e., a document that mentioned our services and how competitive we were for the business being offered. Bruce would often try to sweeten any deal by taking out the prospective client for lunch or dinner, all expenses paid for. Bruce would often invite me to join him in these informal sales meetings. Most of the time I would sit there like a plum, given no idea how to contribute. I tried to look agreeable, often looking in his direction and nodding as he talked. Bruce would often emphasise a point by smiling; it didn’t beam like Elliot’s. It was a forced, almost excruciating looking facial expression. It could, in some circles, be described as gurning. I was always happy to be there. It was a free meal with copious rounds of coffee/beer, paid for by the company. I was of the mindset that, given the options available on the menu, I should order the most expensive. Bruce was too engaged with the client to work that one out, which was nice. Out of all the business deals that Bruce had wined and dined for. In his 2 years at K.J.Ross &Associates he contributed to the success of 2 work orders. All other business deals were signed because of Kelvin’s, the owner, reputation. It was my turn to play host for the evening. I met up with Elle at Circular Quay. We enjoyed a relaxing “cruise” on the Manly Ferry Service, across Sydney Harbour to Manly. The sun shone; the reflective quality of the sea made itself known like a beacon atop a freshly painted lighthouse. As we docked, I calmly looked over to Elle to prompt our departure. We held hands and gently strolled onto the pontoon, narrowly avoiding the attention seeking seaside convenience stores. I had no clue where to eat in Manly. I knew of Cole’s, home of the bagged half chicken. Ben Bry Burger, undoubtedly the best burger takeaway in Sydney. Ocean World Restaurant packed a John Dory and Chips to die for. All these choices weren’t, as one would see it, suitable for a romantic sit-down meal. Thankfully, Elle was happy to take lead. With a good eye for eateries, she pointed out an Italian restaurant across the road from Manly Wharf. We carefully crossed and took a seat outside, enjoying the fresh, warm seaside air. Elle and I communicated effectively through kisses, hand-holding and warm embraces. Conversation could be best described as jerky. Elle was much more intelligent than me. She talked rapidly, academically and politically; I had to be switched on to appreciate her viewpoint. She was a final year university politics student grappling concepts that were unfathomable to me, the layman. She would often aim her ideas and her theories at me. Not having studied or discussed my political views much in the past, I was a novice. I was unsure how to respond to her views. So, I chose to look as attentive as I could, and hope Elle would change the subject. I chose not to change the direction of the conversation. I’m not sure she would have appreciated my knowledge of automobiles, passed down to from engineering family. I’m not sure my closed question “did you know that Ford’s Escort RS Cosworth shares the same chassis as a Ford Sierra?”, would have flowed on nicely from Elle’s “Do you think residents of our state are free to engage in any business they choose? “Ford, the car manufacturer, does have a footing in Australian culture with its gas guzzling family saloon, the Falcon and Commodore respectfully. By the time I had reached their shores, both Ford and Holden were on fighting terms with engine power output. The beefy aging V8 engines of both vehicles were being tuned to within an inch of their lives by their respective in-house tuning companies FSV and HSV(SV meaning Special Vehicles). Both had models that could easily top 400 bhp, which lead to very quick acceleration times and serious, serious noise. I loved the sound of the Aussie V8s from Ford and Holden. The tone was like the growl of a beast amplified to 11. The look of these vehicles too, set apart from their standard siblings with boxier wings, bonnet and boot gave them the muscle that would make them unmistakeable on the open road. They were Australia’s mobile cod-piece extender. I loved everything about them, minus the emissions and fuel consumption. By jingo they even had a UTE (short for utility)version of each “mad” special vehicle. Given the space in the back, it would suit any nut job that needed to transport their flock or building materials at speed, with little care whether the contents of the boot would be in one piece at the destination. Elle and I sat outside the Italian Restaurant as dusk settled in. We had enjoyed a relaxing evening together. We split the bill before strolling towards the Esplanade, hand in hand. Elle enthusiastically asked if she could see the Manly flat share. I didn’t share her enthusiasm. Several factors could fuckup the possible scenario: fleas, big cat shits, a bohemian French lady and an English stoner. I tried not to show my true feelings. Instead I nodded like a cheap miniature toy dog on a car dashboard. “Yeah, I’ll have to show you the place” I said unenthusiastically. Elle and I stood at the entrance to the block of flats. I tentatively inserted the door key and applied my body weight to prize the door open. I turned the stairwell light on and walked up the flight of stairs to the front door of the apartment. Another key turn, another jolt and we were in. I flicked on the hallway light, paused and listened. The flat was deserted. I looked back at Elle with a grin on my face indicating my relief. We walked towards the kitchen. Uncharacteristically, there wasn’t any signs of cat shit. What lay between Elle and I and my bedroom were a few strips of flea-bitten carpet. Any flea bites could be avoided if we were swift. The door to my room required a good dose of WD40. It creaked like a 18th Century pirate ship. Once inside the bedroom with door closed, we were safe from the elements. With a guest in tow I looked at my room in a more judgemental light. It was barely fit for someone who was accustomed to living without a home, let alone an IT Professional. Thankfully, Elle looked happy. Elle confidently walked around the bed. She ran her fingers on the light bed sheets that were untidily arranged on the mattress. She perched herself on the end of the bed, inviting me a look which could be translated to: Fuck me here. Fuck me now. A number of thoughts went through my head: “Great, the apartment has not put the fear of god in her”, “I hope I can sexually perform, remember last time? “I took no time in finding her first erogenous zone, the back of her neck, which I kissed. She began sucking my penis. Elle’s technique was unique: She twisted her mouth, lightly gritted her teeth and slurped. It felt great, but I was only slightly stimulated. In the game of sex, it was my time to serve. I worked my way from Elle's neck down to her vagina. I checked the state of my penis as I continued licking her other erogenous zone. I wasn’t erect and I was beginning to become stressed. I had no reason why I was experiencing erectile dysfunction. Elle had performed well, but it just wasn’t going to be enough that night. As I continued to go down on her I, again, had to improvise. Not being able to use my flaccid penis, I used the next best appendage, my fingers. I used my digits like a button-bashing video game. Given grit and stamina, I finger fucked Elle. The pace slowed. Both of us looked at each other. The sweat streamed down our faces as we caught a breath. Elle was beaming, exclaiming “I’ve never come 3 times before!” We didn’t get a great deal of sleep that night. We were too busy exploring each other's bodies. When we were both wide awake we began chatting. I lay back, with the back of my head firmly against the pillow. Elle lay on her front and rested her head on her hands. She began small talk, “that night was special” she said. She described her past sexual highlights, passing out with ecstasy on one occasion. She excitedly pointed out that she had never come 3 times before. She lay on her back and shuffled her body close to mine. Facing me she again exclaimed “3 times! “Elle said she was concerned about my erectile dysfunction. “The first time we slept together I accepted you may have had issues having sex, I senses it was your first time in a while.” Elle said. “Given we’ve been close for a while now, that shouldn’t be the case. Don’t you find me attractive?”, Elle said. I removed all doubt she may have had by quickly responding, “No!”. At that moment I felt alone, I didn’t have an answer to “why?” I thought back to the last time I had sex without issues. I was 26, my colleagues and I were enjoying a weekend of excess in Prague. I had sex with a prostitute in a penthouse apartment. It was very easy to perform sexually, but why? What was it about the encounter with the prostitute that sexually excited me? Why didn’t Elle sexually excite me? Elle, as cute as she was, and as good a sexual technique she had, I did not find sexually attractive. What I found sexually attractive had been skewed during my adult life thanks to pornography. I could no longer relate to normal sexual intercourse. When I was with Elle, I didn't think I had problems of a sexual nature. I had never constructed an answer as to why I had a problem. She looked concernedly at me and told the story of a male friend of hers. He discovered that he was gay. Elle suggested to me to go see a doctor. With that, she got changed and left. My mind was scrambled, I felt frustrated, confused and elated at the same time. I made my girlfriend orgasm 3 times but didn’t penetrate her. What the hell was wrong with me? Was I the only person out there to have this problem? I thought only the old suffered from erectile disorders. Why was it me? I was 30, in the prime of my life. Whenever Elle texted, she would ask if I had contacted the doctors. Thanks to her relentless prompting I finally built up the courage to contact the Manly Practice GP to book a consultation. That dreaded day came, a day to swallow my pride and enter the GP’s reception. I walked up to the information desk and whispered my name to the receptionist. She asked, “please take a seat Mr Clarke, the GP will be with you soon.” I felt anxious. I ran my hand over my brow wipe away the sweat. I looked at the coffee table in front of me. I couldn’t even entertain reaching for a recent copy of a donated Car Magazine. I looked up at the clock on the wall and watched the seconds hand rotate through a full 360 degrees. I really wished something would happen right here, right now, to suspend this moment for another… lifetime. “Mr Clarke?”, a voice said. I looked around to see a short lady, loud in voice with a distinctive Asian tinge to her Australian accent. I clambered to my feet and walked into her office. The room was a regular office with a simple operating bed. Doctor Chan asked me to take a seat and explain why I wanted to see her. I cleared my throat, looked up and saw Doctor Chan with a clipboard, pen and paper. She afforded me her complete attention. I paused to organise my thoughts, building up the courage to speak to a stranger. I feared that whatever was going to be said would be covering new ground and may lead to a reassessment of my life. No pressure. I cleared my throat, “Well… I am having issues…”, I got to the point, “I cannot keep an erection.” I paused, my heart racing. “How long have you had these issues for?” Doctor Chan asked. I was not trusting enough to mention specifics. “Erm, this has been an issue for a while”, I replied. Ms Chan continued with the questioning, “How many sexual partners have you had?” I felt a deep-seated embarrassment by the answer I was about to give, “5”, I said. “Have you had any sexual encounters with men?” Ms Chan asked. Being asked point blank if I had homosexual encounters shocked me. I paused to absorb, hesitating as I answered a question about my sexuality, “…no!?” . With all questions asked, Mrs Chan began delivering her recommendations: “See a sexual health officer to chat further about your feelings”. “If you would like, I can offer a prescription of Viagra”, she said. I thanked her for her advice. I declined the medication but did take a business card detailing the sexual health officer. I made my way to the sights, sounds and smells of Manly’s esplanade. I looked at the contact card that Doctor Chan had handed to me. I chewed my bottom lip, looked away and back again at the card details. I was angry with myself. Why is my sexuality not straight forward? What is wrong with me? I was finding it frustrating to come to terms with a perception of me that might not be heterosexual. What was I? I found women attractive. Women sexually stimulated me. I found men attractive. They made my heart race but didn’t sexually stimulate me. I never desired sleeping with men. I did try to contact the sexual health worker; unfortunately, I didn’t get through the single time I tried. The communications between me and Elle were tense in the days and weeks after our night in Manly. Thankfully, it was leading up to Australia Day (celebrated annually on 26 January, marking the anniversary of the 1788 arrival of the First Fleet of British ships). There was much fan fair that day. Climate-wise it was a great time to be in Australia. It was the middle of summer, being in Sydney, it was humid. The Sydneysiders celebrated Australia Day by: Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol (a common theme for all public holidays) and listening to Triple J Radio. Triple J Radio played the top 100 Australian Chart Music tracks of the previous year. Early in the morning I received a text from Elle. She asked what my plans were on 26th Jan. Me, lacking any close network of friends at that point, had nothing organised. She asked if I wanted to meet her and her friends in Annandale for Australia Day celebrations. I sat up in my derelict bed and texted her back with a resounding “YES!”. I had a look out the ajar bedroom window. The cool breeze lightly filtered through. The humidity was draining. All I wanted to do was rest. With that thought, I lay down. I reached for my cheap guitar and began playing my signature melody, Metallica’s Nothing Else Matters. The tune required very little effort. Best of all it didn’t require a plastic pick (well not for the first part). I stared at the high ceiling as I played. It was so peaceful in the Manly flat, neither a French nor Southern English accent to be heard. I could have lay there all day. Before I knew, morning had passed, and it was soon approaching leave time to meet with Elle and friends. I submerged into the walk-in-wardrobe to find garments to suit the humid conditions. I wanted to satisfy the needs of the bloody humid conditions. What better clothes to wear than my holiday ensemble consisting of thongs, white cargo shorts and a singlet (vest). It was a style that Australians had a name for, the bogan (unsophisticated person). At the time I was unaware my frowned upon appearance as I made my way towards the buzz of Manly Esplanade. Manly Esplanade hummed to the sound of pretention on the weekends. On Australia Day the pretention and buzz were amplified to a whole new level. The money that drinking establishments make on Australia Day is extraordinary. I made a beeline for the ferry across the Wharf which took me onto Circular Quay. I was able to get out my new iPhone and do what many a generation have done since, ask it for directions. At the time I gawped at the iPhone’s high-tech functionality. It’s ability to locate my every step using the global positioning system (GPS) is amazing. Locate me, locate Annandale, directions. A bus and a walk were its recommendations. So that’s what I did. On the bus I constantly checked my Phone. Are we there yet? I had some idea of where to depart. The exact location was described in Elle’s text. I hurriedly exited the bus and stared at my phone as it pointed me in the direction of a series of apartments, much like Elle’s place. I got to the front door, double checked the address in Elle’s text and pressed the doorbell. Elle appeared at the door immediately. She looked me up and down. Her look sent a mixture of signals, one of disgust and joy. I should have been more sensitive to her reaction to my appearance. I continued as normal, nonetheless. We walked up the steep hallway staircase to the front door of her friend’s apartment. As we approached, I could hear the buzz of social drinking. The door opened. I was confronted by a young ginger haired man dressed in a polo shirt with a beer in his hand. He put the beverage down and reached out and delivered a firm handshake. He introduced himself “George, make yourself at home”. George and Elle went way back. He began telling stories of when Elle and George were in senior school. He described the heated debates that were part of after-school politics sessions. I was to find out that George was the school’s debating champion. My child-like mind immediately thought of something humorous, in this instance it was a play on words, master & debater, masturbator. It was a defence mechanism, to feel superior. I could clearly sense there was a spark between George and Elle. They talked politics and finished each other's sentences. It was difficult not to feel jealous. George walked over to the balcony leaving me and Elle together on the landing. She looked at me and said “why couldn’t you wear a collared T-Shirt? You look like a bogan.” I didn’t mean to offend. I wore what I felt was comfortable from my restrictive wardrobe. My white singlet didn’t raise an eyebrow during my east coast trip. However, being surrounded by tourists not in touch with the intricacies of Australian culture, I was able to pull it off. I looked bemused. I didn’t really know what a bogan was. Given the context and tone of Elle’s voice, it wasn’t something I should be proud of. I still craved Elle’s embrace, even though we weren't on the best of terms, I hugged her. She melted against my body and we kissed. Her angst soon softened as she loosened her grip and walked towards the kitchen. She opened the fridge revealing a raft of alcoholic beverages including wine and ice-cold bottles of Peroni. It was light and gassy, which confirmed to Aussie standards. There was a level of prestige associated with European beers. Having drunk European beers all my adult life, I wanted something different. I looked deeper into the bowels of the fridge. I wanted something cold, dark, flat and Australian. I knew the answer was going to be no before I asked. “any James Squire Winter, Dark Limited-Edition in here?” I said, pulling out a Peroni. Using the ridiculous bottle opener on the bottom of my flip flops (thongs) I prised the lid off. After extracting the grit from top of the bottle I made my way to the balcony where a group of Elle’s mates sat. The balcony overlooked the main street, with views of nothing much other than other houses. George made himself pride and place, sat on the wall in the corner. A slim, young woman of no more than 17years old sat in front of him holding a glass of wine. She was friendly, asking personal questions. I had spoken to so many people since I’d arrived, asking the same sets of questions. Answers were easy to reel off but weren’t delivered with the same enthusiasm that she deserved. As with most Australians, she was miffed to find out that I wasn’t Scottish or Irish. Australians do not expect an English person to have a Midlands accent. It was George’s time to talk. He, like most Australians, was well-versed in politics. He talked about the state of Australian politics, comparing them with current UK politics. I found it difficult to follow his line of conversation and add any value. I found it embarrassing, I was an ambassador for my country, he knew more about UK politics that I did. Elle became the centre of the conversation. She talked in great depth about her political views on current affairs. George and Elle would take turns presenting their point of view. It was like watching a musical duet talk politics. I continued drinking the bottle of Peroni that was beginning to warm. Australians would often berate the English (or Pomms as they lovingly called us) for drinking warm beer. In Australian culture, drinking beer that was above 1 degrees C was frowned upon. The slim, young woman turned the sound up on the radio. Triple J radio station blurted its announcement of the top 10 of the top 100. I had not recognised a single track up to this point. A few more beers and some more chat about my homeland came to an abrupt stop. The number 1 track of 2009 was about to be announced. After the expected tense build up, it came as no surprise to find out that UK band Mumford and Sons had the top spot. I hadn’t a clue who they were at the time. After the announcement I looked at the time and began making my excuses to leave to the group. I shook everyone’s hand and thanked them for being great company. I made my way with Elle to the front door. "Dave, I think it would be a good idea if we end our relationship” she said with a heavy heart. It felt somewhat shocking, but then again, we weren’t compatible. I was intellectually inferior and couldn’t satisfy her sexually. She then followed up with a bemusing question, “do you want to be fuck buddies?”. A fuck buddy relationship is one purely about sex, no relationship strings attached. Unsurprisingly, I declined. I felt we needed a break; distance makes the heart grow fonder. With a heavy heart I made my way back to Manly. The water at the Sydney Harbour Heads was as flat as a pancake. The sun reflected off the majestic, water bound skyscraper, an ocean liner moored up at Circular Quay. Elle had her Aunt’s car at her disposal for the course of the weekend. She wanted to play tourist guide and show me the Blue Mountains our west. I happily obliged, the Blue Mountains are one of the must-see attractions available from Sydney. I felt uneasy about meeting Elle; it had been a couple of weeks since we last saw each other. The drive in the luxurious Toyota Prius was smooth. Triple J radio was chosen, turned up a notch and sung along to by Elle. It was warm inside the car. The windows were down, allowing a flow of cool-ish air into the cabin. We stopped at a set of traffic lights. Out of the heavens a Huntsman Spider (Australia’s common house spider with a leg span of up to 5”) appeared, landing on the windscreen. This one wasn’t a juvenile and it wasn’t loving the outdoors. It raced towards the open passenger window where I was sitting. It was like a scene from Indiana Jones; Harrison Ford only just managed to grab his hat before the stone entrance slams shut. I managed to operate the electric window, just quick enough to stop the mighty Huntsman from making its way onto my lap. Huntsman Spiders are renowned for hiding away in the crevice of the car’s sun visor.Elle stopped the car at special service station. It served fuel for both the car and people with a sweet tooth. The sweet shop was huge. It held every kind of confectionary an Australian could ask for. It even sold a selection of UK sweets at extortionate prices. Elle gave her recommendations, which I happily followed.Sitting in the car, my hand was deep into the white, paper bag of sweets. I chomped away at the large,multi-coloured gelatinous snake like a possessed kookaburra. Elle asked if she could try one. She wasn’ta confident driver, to not distract her from her view of the road I hung the snake in front of her mouth.It looked erotic, and Elle played up to it, using her tongue and teeth to tease it from my grip.There were many viewpoints to park the car and appreciate the expanse of the Blue Mountains. The reason for its name is because of the blue hue that the eucalyptus trees release. It’s a good 50 miles to reach the Blue Mountains from Sydney. On a clear day it is possible to see the city’s sky scrapers.Elle and I decided to explore the forest canopy a little further. The Blue Mountains funicular, the steepest in the Southern Hemisphere, was more thrilling than the environment we descended into. The slow-moving cable car allowed us to absorb more of the landscape and return us back to the mountain high. We walked a selection of trails. We decided to focus less on our surroundings and more on humourous photo poses. Elle began proceedings, perched on a rock, sitting cross legged with the backs of her palms on top of her knees. I followed, copying and arguably looking more ridiculous with my efforts.It was a really enjoyable day. Unfortunately, it would be last time I would see Elle.

## Chapter 8

### Meet the Expat Community

Dan Allam, the British expat, was becoming a close friend of mine. He kindly offered to share his social life with me, which added substance to my life in Australia. Without Dan, there would be no:• Dragon boat racing event.• Friends in the British expat community.• Flat in Rose Bay.Firstly, what is Dragon Boat Racing? Think of a long canoe consisting of 12 people. Each person sporting a paddle, paddling gracefully in unison, coordinating with the cox, a small fella located at the rear of the boat. When Dan, in passing, mentioned the annual corporate Dragon boat racing competition, he didn’t mention what was going to be involved. It wasn’t going to be a matter of turning up, grabbing an oar and whacking the water as quickly as possible. No, it was going to take a gruelling training regime at least twice a week after work.The main organiser of the E*Trade Dragon Boat Racing effort was an Aussie lady named Helen. Her and her long-term partner were members of the local paddle boat club. They sure knew a thing or two about the art of paddling. They also managed to acquire a cox. Someone who was supposedly the cat’s whiskers of the Dragon Boating amateur scene. This tiny, bald fellow was definitely vocal. During our training sessions over in Paramatta, he organised our team. He supposedly knew what competition wewould be facing on the day of the race. After a number of training sessions, he mentioned, "you guys areup there with the best. We have a good chance of winning if we paddle at our best”.It was a bright, calm morning over at Darling Harbour. I didn’t know what to expect on my arrival. All Idid know was I had to meet the rest of the team in the designated “financial teams area”. As I rounded the corner, I took in the view of Darling Harbour. It was alive with activity; there were oars and singletclad athletes dressed in their financial institution’s colours. Dragon boats of varying oriental designswere parked side-by-side. Surprisingly, there was a huge turnout by the general public to see this spectacle. and a huge spectator turnout.My eyes were the size of saucers as I walked through the participant area. As the epicness of the event became apparent, I felt nervous. Thankfully the stress ebbed away as I saw the white T-Shirts of theE*Trade teams. I went over to speak to the E*Trade Team Captain, Helen. She was glad I had turned up,we now had a full complement of team members. Helen asked me for my T-Shirt size. I replied automatically, “Medium”. She handed me the signature E*Trade sports T-Shirt. The T-Shirt had seen better days, having been recycled from other events. Helen explained what the format of the day’sDragon Boat Racing Event was going to be. She explained what time the E*Trade team was due at thestart line. It was nerve racking to say the least. It was a competition and one where we could potentially win hands down. Well, that’s what our experienced cox iterated during our practice sessions.We all sat at the side lines; the early morning sun was beginning to envelope the harbour. All I could think of when the sun’s rays began to touch my skin was the Australia sun cream application mantra,“slip, slop, slap”. I reached into my bag and applied the factor 50 as the event started. Looking at our competition I felt intimidated. Many of the teams consisted of huge, well built, muscular, Herculean examples of humans. The waters in which they paddled foamed an unearthly bright white wash. I couldn’t help but look at the rest of our team members like lambs to the slaughter. My inner monologue spoke, “we’re going to get annihilated”. All teams looked frighteningly good. I felt confused; a picture ofthe confident cox entered my head. “Why the hell was our cox so confident?!” I thought. Maybe I was overreacting. What seemed like impressive dragon boat performances, wasn’t.The litmus test would be our first event. We walked over to the pontoon where we would enter ourboats. Team members projected words of motivation as we sat on the starting line, side-by-side withother teams. As the boats were carefully lined-up, we looked ahead, readied our oars and awaited forthe sound of the klaxon.“HONK!” We were under way, but we weren’t paddling in unison. I felt I was in step with the beat set by the cox. Unfortunately, the person behind me was not, but the person in front was. My oar was hitting the oar behind; it was more a joust than a paddle. I re-adjusted; we were wasting energy. It was the firsttime we were able to measure our progress against the competing teams, as we looked right and left.There was less of a difference between the teams' positions than I originally thought. As we continued, I realised our boat was slowly inching backwards. It was more “foot-ing” backwards. We crossed the finishing line and proceeded to dig our oars in to the water to decelerate.My team mates helped me out of the canoe; we looked at each other to gauge our efforts.Despondency was shown on the faces of everyone. “Where did we finish?” I wondered. We waited forthe organiser's announcement. Much to the surprise of all, we finished fifth. Given there were oar synchronisation problems during the race, we could improve. We had hope, maybe we could finishhigher in the next races.We were called up again. Round 2. This time we were less nervous and more focussed. Having learnt our lessons from the previous round we sat in the boat, ready for the sound of the klaxon, <HORN!> We setoff at a blistering pace. All of our paddlers were in sync. I watched the competition to my right.Surprisingly, we were edging backwards again at an even quicker rate than in the previous round. Whatwas going on?! We crossed the finishing line. We gave it our all, but I felt a sinking sensation in mystomach. The announcement came... “In sixth position is Team E*Trade”. With that, we were out of the competition. The only race left was the one for the wooden spoon. We came 5th in that, which went some way to mend our broken egos. Overall, it was embarrassing. The team was happy to go theirseparate ways even before the winners were announced. At least it was a sunny day. Unfortunately, thesun didn’t shine on our fortunes. Dan knew I was on the lookout for a new abode. I would often moan about my current living situationwith Flo and the cats. One day, in passing, Dan mentioned his friend, Carl, was moving out of a flatshare. The flat share was located in the beautiful and relatively expensive suburb of Rose Bay. Danforwarded me an email with details of the accommodation. I perused the details, noting the details ofthe flatmate, Becky. The apartment offered views of Sydney Harbour bridge. It was relatively expensivethough, a good couple of hundred dollars per month pricier than the flat in Manly. It didn’t deter me. Iwanted out of Flo’s.I emailed Becky, who replied quickly. She wanted to set a meet up at the flat at the earliest opportunity.“Splendid”, I thought. How difficult could a viewing be? On the weekend I arrived at the flat. I wassurprised to be met by Carl, the flat mate leaving, who warmly invited me in. As I entered, I quicklylooked at the interior. My first thoughts were “small, but how much space do I honestly need?”. Thekitchen was a separate room, located close to the entrance. The living space was large. It was a diningroom and lounge combined. I was led to the balcony that had space for a table and 4 chairs. I was askedto take a seat. I looked to my right. In the distance was a view of Sydney Harbour Bridge. Carl asked if Iwould like a beer. With jaw ajar, eyes fixated on the beautiful view, I nodded. Time seemed toaccelerate as the sun's rays danced on the continuous sea. I barely noticed Carl’s flat mate, Becky. Shesat opposite me on the table. I found out she was a day older than my good self. She had long straightblack hair, a petite stature and complexion as white as snow. She had a proper British accent that was insexy, measured and clear.Carl arrived back to the balcony table with 2 bottles of Victoria Bitter. A beer for him and me. As he satdown the meet and greet turned into a formal interview. Carl played friendly cop, while Becky’s tone ofvoice indicated concern. She fired off the first question, “Tell me about yourself?”. I immediately felt offguard. I hesitated; my hands felt clammy. I thought hard to formulate a formal answer. Having answeredthis question many times in an informal setting, people generally asked:• Who are you?• Why are you here?• What are you drinking?After a lot of practice I had my answers perfected. I was a 30-year-old bloke from Birmingham. I wasforced to leave my previous role because the IT department flagged a porn video on my work laptop. Inever felt comfortable saying the previous sentence. Instead I mentioned the job offered theopportunity to travel and I could earn good money too.Weirdly Carl was talking the most. He didn’t seem bothered asking me personal questions. He appearedhappy with my personality. He used the interview to joke with “serious” Becky and lighten the mood.Becky asked one final question, “how soon can you move in?” I didn’t have a clue what the notice periodwas at the Manly flat. I had no tenancy agreement documentation to reference. I took a guess, stating amonths notice. This answer was foot noted with, “let me chat to my flat mate before I give you adefinitive answer.” Anyway, April was looking likely.Carl looked at my empty beer bottle and asked if I wanted another. I took my phone out to gauge thetime. It was getting late. I wanted to make sure I caught the last Manly ferry from Circular Quay in plentyof time. I stood up and apologised for cutting the meeting short. They both smiled, I reciprocated and walked towards the flat entrance. Carl and Becky took turns to shake my hand before I left. As I walkedto the bus stop, I felt happy with how the interview went.The following day around lunch time I received a text from Becky. Was my gut feel right? Did I get atenancy offer? “Thanks for your time yesterday. Carl and I very much enjoyed your company and believeyou make a great fit for the flat”, read the text. I smiled, replying, “I would be very happy to move in. Letme speak to my flat mate and ask when I would be able to leave.”I’d only been living at the Manly flat for 3 months. Before I moved in, I said to Flo that I would be stayingfor 6 months minimum. I was desperate. I shuddered at the thought of living out of a suitcase, movingfrom one hostel to another. I looked at my living situation now. I had stability, but, like my job, I didn’twant to be loyal to one place. The only issue I had was an awkward legal one, leaving a contract early. IfI could talk to Flo and agree on a suitable move date that would suit her and meet Becky’s needs, thatwould be splendid.The “meeting” that I had with Flo about moving out was less a conversation, it was more an altercation.She made me feel nervous. When I’m nervous I’m blunt, flustered and defensive.I sat in the Manly flat kitchen seeing to my salty chicken supper. I could hear a door clunking, andbanging. Someone had arrived. Given the signature sound, it was Flo. She walked hurriedly into thekitchen. Her curly, long, black, voluminous hair moving like a slinky. It wasn’t the best time to catch her,she looked angry. I didn't have a choice; I rarely saw her; “Hi Flo, I saw a new flat during the week.” I saidhurriedly. She stopped briefly to look in her bag and empty out its contents onto the lounge table. Anirascible, French accented noise exited from her mouth. I continued “the flat is over in Rose Bay. It has abeautiful view of the Sydney Harbour bridge. Best of all it’s available to move into in 2 weeks.”Flo had my cash deposit money, which I gave to her, trusting she would officially deposit it. She neverdid. So, I had no confirmation of the bond and no rental agreement documentation for the Manlyproperty. Officially there was no check out schedule. I asked “How much notice do I need to provide if Iwanted to move out?” Flo’s attention moved quickly from her bag and towards me. She stared at me insilence. Her attention moved back to her bag, “didn’t we agree you would be staying for 6 months?” shesaid quietly. I sheepishly looked at her. Flo’s tone changed. She was clearly angry, “since you’ve movedin you’ve done nothing to help. You don’t clean the communal area and I barely see you around.” I triedto retaliate. “What about the fleas Flo? We have fleas all over the carpet.” I said. Give her calm reaction,she knew of the issue. What I wasn’t ready for was the excuse she was about to deliver. “They’re housefleas” she replied. Holy shit, of all the excuses a person could use, that was up there with the nuttiest.“House fleas?!” I said with a perplexed expression on my face. I might have accepted “they’re part of theFlea Circus that is about to end its world tour”, but Flo’s excuse was pathetic. She put a close to theconversation “now is not a good time. We’ll talk about this tomorrow. I need to get ready for work.” shehuffed.Flo scurried away, slamming her bedroom door closed. I was left in the lounge, heart racing, feelingnone the wiser about my living situation. I was in no mood to finish my half chicken, chips and salad.After taking a deep breath I assessed the situation. How did I get my deposit back and end my tenancyearly? I had no clear answer. Thankfully, my ravenous appetite had returned. It was time to wolf downthe salty chicken! My precious deposit was Flo’s bargaining tool. The next day as I took my Manly Ferries commute to thecity, it’s all I thought about. The verbal agreement that lasted all of a sentence when I first moved in, itmeant nothing. I didn’t have a clue what my rights were and what my next steps should be.I entered the E\*Trade office to see Dan, beaming as always. “How are you this fine morning Mr.Clarke?”, he bellowed. I avoided eye contact and gave a forlorn “I’m alright.” I knew well that theresponse I wanted to give would require a lot of time to answer. Dan was perceptive; he was very skilledat reading into small changes in a person’s body language. I was an open book, and one with very fewpages. “You don’t seem your usual self, what’s up? Is it lady trouble?”, he said. “Kind of. I took a look atthe flat you mentioned. I loved it. Great little place. Becky and Carl are really nice. I would love to movein at the earliest opportunity. The flat in Manly is a shit hole. The problem is, my land lady. I verballyagreed with her back in January that I would be staying for at least 6 months. I know a verbal agreementisn’t worth anything. I have paid a deposit which, Flo, the landlady has in her possession. How do I goabout leaving the flat and still keep my deposit?” I stressed.Dan was on it. He Googled "tenant’s rights in Australia”. “It looks like you as a tenant have many rights.It says here, if you haven’t signed any agreement you just need to give written notice. Your deposit issafe; I can write a letter for your landlady if that helps?” he said. “Yeah, sure, that would be great.”, Ireplied. This caring side Dan was showing, I hadn’t seen before. “There”, he said, handing me a letterfresh from the computer printer. “Have a read of that, I can update it if need be. If it looks good givethat to your landlady and see what she has to say.” Dan said boldly. I looked at the print like it was agolden ticket to Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. I beamed as I read out my rights as a tenant. “This isbrilliant Dan, thanks very much.”I now felt happier with the flat situation, knowing my rights as a tenant. I got back to the flat after a longday. I walked sheepishly into the kitchen, pulled out my golden ticket and placed it carefully on thekitchen table top. I looked down at it. An element of doubt entered my head. The “What-Ifs” began toplay in my head. I lay in bed and looked blankly at the high ceiling. This place I called home; I wasbeginning to divorce myself from. I wanted to move into the Rose Bay flat immediately. With all goodthings, I had to wait, for Flo.The next morning, I walked into the kitchen. I noticed the letter that Dan had crafted was missing fromthe counter. I looked around. “Could it have fallen on the floor?”, I whispered to myself. I avidlysearched, nothing. I felt nervous, the “What-Ifs” began to play again in my head. I wasn't lookingforward to the next meeting with Flo.After a day at the office I returned to the Manly flat. As I entered, I could hear the unmistakeable,hurried presence of Flo. As I walked towards the kitchen, I then caught a glimpse of the barbaric, blackcurls of her hair. Nervousness hit me. I made my way wearily towards her. I tenuously greeted her, “HiFlo”, I said. Flo cocked her head to look at me and exhaled heavily through her flared nostrils.The one-sided conversation began. “So, I found your letter”, Flo said firmly. ‘Cool, I hope she read andagreed with it all.’, I thought. She continued with a question. “Did you know that my boyfriend works inthe police force?”, she asked. I thought briefly about this closed question. The answer that initiallypopped into my head was “yes, but what does that have to do with the letter?”. I took a deep gulp andtried to speak calmly. “Errr, no”, I replied. This was an obvious lie. The volume of and pace of Flo’s voiceincreased markedly. “How dare you write something like this!”, she exclaimed. The last time I had experienced a dressing down like this was at senior school. The teacher read a joke in the back of myEnglish Language book; the punchline was “mega-sore-arse". She paused, with hands on hips and a gazefixed on me she said, “I will not be giving you your deposit back, plain and simple.” With that she left thekitchen area and slammed her bedroom door.‘Well, that could have turned out better… ‘, I thought. That was it then, I could leave early. If I did, mydeposit would be staying. I sighed deeply. I seeked comfort, which for me meant food. Not just any food,I needed a special BenBry Burger meal. I was in luck. It was Thursday, which meant the all-day specialwas available: Benbry Burger, chips, sauce and soft drink for a wallet-tickling AU\$12.I sat outside Benbry Burger in the company of the seagulls and the Thursday special. The crash of thewaves on the shores of Manly Beach brought a feeling of calm. I wanted to savour this moment. I bitslowly into the sumptuous, sweet tasting Benbry Burger. I sighed, reclined and smiled. A positivethought popped into my head, ‘forget about the deposit, it’s time to move on’.Dan invited me for a drink in Manly, with him and his expat mates one sunny afternoon. Up until thatpoint I had socialised with a people of varying nationalities, mainly British and Australian. Of thosepeople, Dan was my closest friend. I didn’t realise I lived in a bubble back in the UK. I found it easier tosocialise with others from my home country. The European Sydney-siders shared the same culturalreference points, a common language and many historical references. The difference was, EuropeanSydney-siders: knew of gum trees, marsupials, huge swaths of isolated environments & temperateconditions. They were laidback, living in a class-less society. People were proud of their rebellious,convict roots.I noticed Dan standing in a drinking circle with a group of 10 people. He was chatting to a sun burned,ginger haired bloke who wore black rimmed glasses. He could have easily been mistaken for a fatversion of Chris Evans (a British TV & radio celebrity). I smiled and indicated my presence to Dan bylifting my arm in the air. He looked wide-eyed and raised his half-full pint glass. “Mr Clarke, good to seeyou made it. This is Carlos.” he said nervously. Carl smiled, transferred his pint to his other hand, andshook my hand. In a quiet British accent, he introduced himself, “Hi my name is Carl, as you know fromour brief meeting over at Rose Bay. Welcome to the British ex-pat community. Grab yourself a drink atthe outdoor bar over there. When you come back, I’ll introduce you to the rest of the gang.”, he said.The outdoor bar was situated in front of the beautiful a calm Manly sea scape. Having seen what theothers were drinking, and wanting to fit in, I ordered a common Sydney draught beer, Toohey’s New.The barman took a schooner (425ml) glass out of the fridge and began pouring. Given the humidity, colddrinks warmed quickly. I returned to Carl; he took a sip of his drink before delivering the groupintroductions.There was Andy, Johnny, Pete, Dan… Each person said hello, some even threw in a quick introduction. Ifelt comfortable around them. They showed British personality traits, reminding me of my best friend’spersonalities back in Birmingham. They didn't need to be like for like replacements of my best friends.They just needed to be English, male, my age and social drinkers.Australia would teach me the meaning of friendship: what bonded me to people and how difficult it wasto make friends. I didn’t question my interests at the time. What were they? What did I enjoy doing herein Australia? My interests were inspired by my life in the UK, especially social drinking, which I didn’t realise at the time. I appreciated the taste of beer. Beer in the UK was sourer, darker and flatter thanAustralian beer. I slowly acclimatised to the refreshing taste of beer in Australia.I enjoyed laymen’s terms conversation when drinking. I was happy to let people talk. I was a goodlistener. Pubs were a great place to socialise. Alcohol is a drug that improves a person’s ability tosocialise, to talk about whatever thoughts occupy their minds. Unfortunately, the quality of the verbalcontent can degrade when the quantity is increased.Australian bars showed a range of local sports all day on big screens. Rugby League was the sport ofchoice in Sydney. Australian league rugby was arguably of higher quality that found in the UK. TheRoosters and Rabbitohs were the top 2 Sydney teams. Rugby, and sports in general, heavily influencedthe Sydney culture.I loved the evening weather in Sydney. When the sun set the temperature was perfect. The humidityhelped the heat linger. Unfortunately, the mosquitos were present as a result. The clandestine critterswere rarely bit an Aussie. The mosquitos seemed to treat an Australian as one of their own. It wascommon for Australians to mock the "Poms” lack of immunity to mosquito bites.Being a social drinker was a great excuse to get outdoors in Sydney. The average Sydney bar cateredhandsomely for those choosing to drink there. UK pubs had the beer garden with benches. Australianbars had everything bar the kitchen sink. If the entertainment was poor and the beer tasted bad, otherbar options were outstanding.The amassed group of Brits at The Manly Bar were looking more towards their watches than towardsthe next drinking venue. It suited me. I was happy to stay, home was round the corner. The first of thewatch-watchers was Dan. He’d barely touched his drink; it was obvious he didn’t want to be there. Thetext from his wife was an excellent excuse for him to begin his hour plus journey home. I continued myconversation with Carl. He had plenty to say about the new flat share with Rebecca.

## Chapter 9

### A British rose

I was so happy to be moving. I believed the new living experience would be much better than the one Iwas leaving. The cost of rent was more, but I was gaining an improved quality of life. Becky, my new flatmate, was British. It was going to be easy to talk to her without the need for me to pretext everythingwith laborious context. The flat was going to be devoid of fleas; it was going to be serviced by aprofessional cleaner once a week. The improved view, a lack of cats and a French dishevelled femalecook. The positives were numerous.The only minor issues I was facing, well initially, was a lack of furniture. I was informed the bedroomwould be unfurnished before I moved in. Having taken Carl’s advice, during drinks in Manly, I had theforesight to buy a bed prior to moving in. It was, unfortunately, going to be delivered 3 days after Iarrived. In the meantime, I had to purchase bedding. Where could I purchase high quality bedding tosuit the classier Rose Bay apartment, Myer. Myer was a high-quality Australian department store inSydney City Centre. The warm conditions would require the purchase of a light doona (duvet) andbedsheet. I also required high quality bed cushions to smother my head with feathery kisses. I had noidea of what the cost of bedding would be. After the bedding items were scanned and bagged, the totalcost was north of $100.One mistake I had made before agreeing to move in to the apartment, was not questioning the homeinternet connection. I was a big internet user, influenced by my work as an IT professional. The internetsolution in Rose Bay was based around mobile phone technology, which was very slow at the time. Onfirst use I searched the world wide web for superfast internet deals near me. Carl had described why theapartment had a mobile internet setup. It was to accommodate Becky and her need to call her family inthe UK. My superfast internet search endeavours were paying off. I found a deal that would allow: Beckyto phone home, me a fast internet connection and $5 to be saved on the monthly bill. I discussed theinternet deal with Becky, who hesitantly agreed to make the proposed switch. All in, it took 2 weeks to upgrade the service.Carl had taken his big screen TV when he moved out. This left a noticeable space on the TV stand whichneeded to be amended as a matter of urgency. After a brief chat with Becky, the conclusion was, yes, abig screen TV was a nice to have. In the interim we made do with a small TV she borrowed from herbedroom. It was going to be a matter of time before the inadequacies of the small TV and my increasedbank balance would result in me buying a new TV.Ask any Australian about ANZAC Day and they will immediately educate you on it’s significance. For theaverage British person, it won’t “ring any bells”. Should it? Funnily enough it’s significance is directlyrelated to a decision made during World War I by the British. After the educational session it is apparentthat in 1915, 25th April, the British led it’s loyal Antipodean brethren on a death march over in Gallipoli,Turkey. The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) were drafted in to fight on the GallipoliPeninsula. They were outnumbered, outgunned and were disadvantaged by their poorer strategicposition. It was the only war the Turkish forces won during WWI.After this education and a subsequent information about America’s role. America rescued Australia froma Japanese offensive in the WWII fight in the Pacific. It became clear why Australians of British descent, even though they are historically connected to the motherland, feel an undertow of resentment for the British. ANZAC day is a public holiday in Australian and New Zealand. It occurs on April 25th, commemorating theBattle of Gallipoli in WWI. There is a togetherness in Australian society that such a day brings, which ismissing in British public holidays. The average Brit knows not of this day, and further knows not of abetting game associate with it, Two-Up! Two-Up is a simple betting game, made legal on ANZAC day atdrinking establishments across the country. It’s something that everyone should experience.It was a warm evening over in Coogee. I had arranged to meet the British Expat group and also my oldQueenscliffe flat mate, Andi Walker. The meeting place, the infamous Coogee Bay Hotel(CBH). I sayinfamous, it had featured in many negative news articles in the Sydney press on issues related todrunken disorderly behaviour. It was a huge place with a monumental outdoor seating area. I was soonto find out it had a huge indoor area too, to showcase the game of two-up.I put the effort in with my clothes that night (I wanted to avoid looking like a “dero”). On arrival to CBH Irecognised the group of expats. I thought the British men’s Expat group was significant in numbers. Thenumbers of British women exceeded that number, taking the group to the size of a small village. As Iapproached, people who recognised me began to smile and offer a shake of the hand. Cullen, agirlfriend of an expat named Andy, went above and beyond to get to know me and present me to thenew members of the group. It felt great to be accepted at a time when I was becoming home sick. Thesepeople were going to be my shoulders to cry on.Something I did question about the group was its size. How could so many people belong to one socialgroup? it was formed from three subgroups: Andy’s, Carl’s and Johnny’s friends. These fine gents hadhigh levels emotional intelligence. They were great listeners, able to interact with people of varyingpersonalities. It was clear there was an undercurrent of mounting tension between these 3 groups.Andi finally arrived. She looked stunning: tall, 6’ with heels on. She wore a commanding, huggable reddress to complement the rest of her outfit. "Dave" she shouted confidently. As I turned round to seeher, my jaw dropped. Out of my periphery I could see men appreciate her too. I was a littleembarrassed, as she approached. The unwanted attention was now drawn towards me. I nervouslysmiled.Andi was gracious in presenting herself to the group. She was not too brash as to embarrass and not toodull as to tarnish her natural sparkle. As the group settled and the appreciators retreated, I began to feelcomfortable and enjoy being in Andi’s company. I even thought, “imagine if she was my girlfriend? Howjealous would people be of me?”. After a big hug, I introduced Andi to my new, impressed friends,including: Andy, Johnny and Carl. After the introductions, Andi turned her attentions to me. Sheindicated that she wasn’t here just to see me, her other friends were sitting inside. Andi munificentlymade her excuses to leave, but left an open invitation to me. Andi announcing “hey Dave I’ll be inside ifyou want to meet up later.” “Cool” I replied. Given the lack of a group plan, and the slow dispersal of thethree sub-groups, it would be a short time before I would see Andi again.Most of the group British Ex-pats had been hanging around CBH for the whole day. As the sun slowlydipped, I was only one drink in when people began making plans to leave. I was in a sociable mood,ready to see how far I could make it into the early hours. I said goodbye to the ex-pats and made my way to the indoor bar area of CBH. Inside it was equally packed with people as it was outside. I circuitedthe bar multiple times, but I couldn’t see Andi. As I took my final lap, I recognised Andi’s voice above thebar room banter, “Dave! We’re over here!” The relief hit me as I saw her by a table with her friends.I smiled, and said my hellos to the group. I hoped Andi’s mates were planning on staying at the CBH.From listening in on their conversation, thankfully this was the situation. The plan that they were aboutto agree on would be a welcome surprise. Andi’s friend Steve said, “what do you guys think about goinginto the hall and playing a game of Two-Up”. At the time I knew little of the game and had yet toexperience playing it. With a legal blind eye turned towards Two-Up today, now would be a good timefor me to try.We walked from the bar to, what only could be described as a cavernous, dark hall. Given the amount ofspace occupied by the outdoor drinking area and indoor bar, I was surprised there was room left for ahall. It took a few moments for my eyes to adjust to the low light levels. Steve, Andi and I approached alarge gathering of people holding aloft their money. We stopped and observed the action from acomfortable distance to listen and learn. We could see 2 officials with paddles of coins in a measuredspace at the centre of the crowd. “What were they doing?” I said to Steve. The penny literally droppedas game one finished. We were witnessing a game of heads and tails that generally followed these steps:1. Wait for the previous game to end.2. Shout “HEADS” or “TAILS”.3. Find a person who:a. shouted “TAILS” to your “HEADS” or vice versa.b. Wants to wager the same bet as you.4. Wait for the officials to release the coins and shout the outcome.5. Claim your winnings or give hand over your losses.After an hour of moving between the 2 betting stages, I had broken even. At that point, I stoppedbetting and watched the action on the larger stage. At one-point Andi was asked to join the officials tothrow a set of coins, much to the amusement of me and her friends. As midnight approached, I washappy to take lead and head home. It was comforting knowing I only had a short journey to my newhome in Rose Bay.I skim read an email I received from Andy Walker. The content described meeting up on the weekend. Iflagged it and re-read it days later. One incorrect assumption I had made was who the email was from. Ithought it was from my NZ lady friend Andy Walker. Nope, this was Carl’s UK male mate Andy Walker.An ex-pat I had first met in Manly. Why did this person want to contact me? Of the ex-pats, it wasJohnny and Carl that I had assumed would want to contact me. I felt honoured to be more popular.Andy reminded me of Paul McCartney, similar height, but more athletic in physique. He was a sportsenthusiast, he talked about surfing, swimming, running, snowboarding. He led a fun packed life. I washappy to reply to his email with an enthusiastic response. Andy was quick to reply, suggesting to meet atLuna Park, Milson’s Point (located the other side of Sydney Harbour Bridge), on Saturday, 26th April.Cc’d in to the email was Becky, my new flattie and Andy’s girlfriend Cullen. To make it even moreinteresting, there was mention of Cullen’s mother making an appearance too. She had arrived recentlyfrom the UK and occupied Andy and Cullen’s spare room. I was later to find out that the meet up was mainly for the benefit of Cullen’s mom. Andy wanted her out the apartment. She had no home skills andexpected to be waited on hand and foot.Luna Park drew memories of yester-year. A 1930’s fairground, refurbished in 2004 to cater for tourismrelated to the Olympics games. Becky had a car and insisted on driving me and her from the Rose Bayflat to Luna Park. Andy, Cullen and Cullen’s mom aimed to meet us at the entrance. It was a gorgeousAutumn day; not a cloud in the sky. Becky and I parked nearby and walked through the ornate, circusinfluenced Luna Park entrance. We reached the peer; Becky reached for her phone in her handbag,“Andy, are you here yet?” she asked. She slowly turned, looked towards the entrance and smiled. Ifollowed the direction of her gaze. Three enthusiastic looking people, I recognised Andy and Cullen. Theother, I presumed, was Cullen’s mom. They quickened their step, reaching us with arms wide open. Thehigh levels of enthusiasm and emotion were something I wasn’t used to. In contrast, Cullen’s Momlooked grumpy. I shook Andy’s hand; I engaged Cullen and Cullen's mom with an awkward hug.I realised I was a reserved person, even by British standards. I felt awkward being in physical contactwith people. Prior to landing in Australia, I had rarely hugged or kissed people. It was something I justdidn’t do growing up; my family & friends rarely showed their emotional sides.I “released” Cullen and her mom from my awkward embrace and smiled. What do they say about firstimpressions? For me, this was less of an impression, but more a transaction. The women split off fromthe group. Andy and I began to chat away enthusiastically. On hearing Andy’s strong southern accent, Iengaged my Birmingham accent. I said “how’s it going?”. Andy replied with an upbeat tone to his voice,“yeah, not bad, not bad.” It was refreshing hearing the more British answer to that question. The Aussieamplified adjectives took the shine off the upper limits of the English language.Andy began to chat about his love for Australian outdoor activities. I thought I loved being active. Andyput me to shame. He began rattling off the list: Swimming, Surfing, Marathon Running, Mountain Biking,Snowboarding. He caught my attention with the last activity in the list. “Where can you snowboard inAustralia?” I asked. “Do you snowboard?” he replied. I tried to be modest in my response, “yeah, I’vebeen to a few resorts: Saalbach/Hinterglem in Austria; Andorra, on the border of Spain and France.” Bywinter sports enthusiast's standards, my experience was tame. I think I had spent more time at my localindoor slopes than any other venue. Out of embarrassment, I prematurely stopped my snowboarding chapter and verse. I looked over to Andy, his eyes were the size of saucers. He enthusiastically asked,“Do you fancy heading over to Thredbo? I’ve had a look at the weather recently. There is supposed to bea few inches of snow on the slopes. Failing that, they do have snow blowers to add a covering.” What afriendly and trusting bloke. I barely knew Andy, for him to invite Becky and I to Luna Park was going outthe way. For him to talk of the opportunity to snowboard in Australia. I was overwhelmed to put itlightly. With an enthusiastic, Australian inflected tone I said, “yeah, perfect.” “Cool, what’s your phonenumber? I’ll text you when I find out more.”, he replied.Andy and I turned our attention to Cullen, her mom and Becky. Cullen's mom had a rush of nostalgiawhen she saw the colourful, undulating, wooden slide that stretched many lanes, but wasn’t particularlysteep. Cullen began to smile, feeding off her mother’s excitement. “Come on, shall we have a go?”,Cullen said eagerly. Andy laughed and shrugged his shoulders, “why not, you only live once.” he said. Itwas a motto that defined him, given his already impressive life experience. At the top of the slide we realised there weren’t enough lanes to fit all 5 of us. We split the groupaccording to gender. We put chivalry aside. Andy and I quickly grabbed mats and began our slide-ydescent. Andy asked the carny (slide operator), what technique delivered the best experience. “Headfirst mate” he said, which is what Andy selected. I chose the standard toes first technique, but made mybody was as aerodynamic as possible.Andy began to cackle as he lay on the hessian matt. He turned to the women and said “right could yougirls give me a push on 3?” The ambers of my competitive nature had been stoked to a warming glow. Iwaited for the countdown, which Becky took charge of. She bellowed as good as her lungs could give,“3,2,1 GO!” Andy and I got off the start quickly. Andy’s lucrative chest-to-mat positioning was provinginferior to my missionary style bum-to-mat. I began accelerating. Andy on the other hand was losingcontrol and giggling frantically. He managed to spin himself and the mat a full 360 degrees. I, conversely,glided smoothly to the huge black breaking matts at the bottom.I didn’t outwardly celebrate the win, but mentally I felt extremely pleased. Andy eventually arrived andlaughed out loud. Cullen shouted from the top of the slide “Are you all right love?”. Andy replied “yeah,all good, just a few mat burns, but that’s all.” It was the ladies turn. They all ignored the carny’s advice.They chose the conventional sit up, grip and slide. From the huge grins on their faces, it was clear theywere having a blast. All were laughing as they picked themselves and their mats up at the bottom of theslide. We continued our Luna Park tour, experiencing some of the more traditional rides including:dogems, waltzers and basketball before heading home. A great day for a once in a blue moonexperience.When you buy a car, you don’t think about how many of that car model are on the road. The same canbe said for Canadians. Dave Playford was the first Canadian I had met in Australia. I knew little of hisexpansive homeland. I discovered that Canadians are a proud people. Their cultural heritage iscelebrated, wherever in the world they are, on a day aptly named Canada Day. There were lots ofCanadians in Sydney thanks to Australia’s close links with other Commonwealth countries (This was a bigreason why I was there). Canada Day celebrations were being advertised at many of Sydney's pubs.Andi was my first true female friend. She was a trusting individual, happy to include me in her socialcircles after she split with her boyfriend Glen. Andi was positive and energised, which made her a verypopular person. My laid-back personality complemented her laid-back attitude to social drinking. OnCanada Day, June 27th, Andi was heading to a pub located near St. James’s Park, Sydney CBD, with herfriend Mel. I was hoping, much like my personality, it was going to be a relaxed evening.With it being June, the already short days were becoming shorter. It would be considered a goodweather day in any other part of the world, definitely so in Canada. I had a quick look at the entrance ofthe bar Andi had mentioned. Its theme was heavily influenced by Bavaria and North America. I walkedinside, there were lots of big screens TVs hung on walls. They were all showing various classic Canadianhockey games. Small, blue, ice buckets surrounding the bar counter. They were filled with a selection ofCanadian beers: Moosehead, Molson and Coors. These buckets could be purchased for very little, whichlent itself to an evening that may not be that relaxed after all.I saw Andi perched on the bar wearing a Canadian NHL top. She wore it well, given her svelte figure.Stood beside her, at a commanding 5’10”, was her Northern English friend Mel: Blonde, cute, curvy. Shewas the same age as Andi, but still looked young, more 30 than 37. I was magnetised to her. I knew she wasn’t interested, even though she was single. From our quick chat she had a demanding job, eventorganiser. She was the type that required a man with an equally commanding job to pull her heartstrings. I was happy I didn't annoy her with my chat up lines. The only reason she didn’t leave was out ofrespect for Andi. Andi, Mel and I had fun that evening. We walked around, chatting to various groups ofCanadians, shared beers and in some cases their attire.I was forming a close friendship with Andy the expat. From our deeper conversations it was obvious hewas having second thoughts about life with girlfriend Cullen. He may not have been enjoying thecompany of Cullen, but loved the recent slushy snowboarding experience at Mount Buller. I had a blasttoo. Andy and I agreed it was time to take our snowboarding to the best slopes in the SouthernHemisphere. We had to leave the beautiful seaside scenes of Sydney and fly to a place calledQueenstown. This outdoor sports Mecca was located on the South Island of New Zealand.Andy and I took weeks to organise the trip. Andy set about getting Queenstown slightly differently tome, by shit box. He purposefully timed the visit to coincide with the arrival of a few Aussie friends offriends.I was standing in Terminal 1 at Sydney Airport. My dusty snowboarding gear, recently arrived in a hugebox from the UK, was packed away in a big bag and hold-all. This gear was going straight to theoversized luggage area. It was going to my first time flying with Air New Zealand. I was really lookingforward to it, having read about their excellent level of service in a travel article. Their in-flight safetyvideos are the funniest of any airline. As the plane began its take off, the 2010 Rugby World Cup teaminspired video played, I was captivated. By the end of the briefing I thought “those Kiwis have anawesome sense of humour”.The flight from Sydney to Queenstown was direct. I’m not one for watching out of the passengerwindow. The approach to Queenstown airport is epically beautiful; there is a small amount ofturbulence as the mountain air buffets the airplanes wings. As the mountains came into view, I couldhear the passengers deliver a cacophony of “wows”.Queenstown airport is a short car journey from town. I opted to take a taxi driven by a random SouthAmerican chap. The drive was stunning; it twisted and turned its way around the mountains. There werelaybys on the road corners; it allowed cars to park up and tourists to admire views of Lake Wakapitu. Iwas half-tempted to ask the driver to do as such. Unfortunately, I was too focussed on our conversation,one about life in New Zealand and Liverpool Football Club.

As we arrived into Queenstown I was initially underwhelmed. It was small, the David Jones store in Sydney was more formidable than the whole town. It did pack a lot into humble estate. There were many tourist centres, shops and hostels. The hostels dwarfed every other type of business. I was booked into Nomads backpackers; prior to living in Australia I had never set foot in backpacker accommodation. By the time I had arrived in Queenstown it was the accommodation of choice. Each hostel was a shared living space including: toilet, kitchen and sleeping quarters. I checked in at reception. The hostel provided me with a set of bed sheets and pillow cases. I was assigned the lower bunk of a bed in a 6 person room share. There were 3 bunk beds and enough floor space to swing a mouse by its tail.I couldn’t see the floor, such was the mess of clothes and hair dryers strewn upon it. I tippy-toed my way around the carnage to the vacant bed. I chucked my backpack underneath and headed out.
Andy text me to mention he had landed in Christchurch, picked up the "shit box" rental vehicle and was far from Queenstown. Instead of hanging around in the hostel I went into town to explore. The first feature to catch my eye was the stream that ran through the centre of town. The stream was surrounded by bars; the weirdest and most wonderous was a microbrewery pub for Mac’s Beer, a famous New Zealand brewery. My excitement grew when I entered and saw a plethora limited edition beers on tap. I paid for a paddle, a sample of all available beers. I sampled, and exited in a merrier state. Walking around town I saw a café, an adventure store, more bars and a queue of people that snaked around the building. I looked at the sign above the entrance, it read “Fergburger”. I walked up to a random person in the queue and asked, "what's this place then?". The man replied, "You've never heard of Ferg Burger? It's the best gourmet burger joint in town." The best gourmet burger I had experienced in my life had been served at Manly’s Benbry Burgers. If thta could be bettered, I would be happy to get on the next flight home. The queue was moving quickly, I was hungry and I had time on my hands. 30 minutes later I entered the small diner. There were a large number of staff members on hand, prepare and serving the big dish in a bun. I looked up at the hand written menu behind the counter. Their standard offerings included the Fergburger(beef), Cockadoodle Oink (chicken and bacon), Bun Laden (Falafel with salad) and The Codfather (blue code). Their most extreme burger was the the Big Al. He was ¾ pound of beef, lashings of bacon, a whole lot of cheese, 2 eggs, loads of salad and a big wad of aioli. Fries were at extra cost. When I received my Fergburger I did a double take. I was holding their standard size burger, with a degree of difficulty, given its large size. So big was their burger I had to plan how to eat it. I did what only a fool would attempt, to open my mouth as wide as it could and take a bite. By the time I had finished eating, my jaw muscles ached.

The hectic throb of the Queenstown highstreet made way for the serenity of Lake Wakapitu. There the boats were abundant, offering tours of the serene, expansive body of water. I paused for a minute, took a deep breath and freed my mind of thoughts. It is no wonder why New Zealanders frequently use the adjective “epic”, they are surrounded by so much natural beauty. I broke my gaze of the mountainous backdrop and focussed my attentions back to the throb of town. It was then I noticed the sculpture of the now extinct Moa bird. If only I could have seen this huge animal alive. I took another deep breath and walked towards the hostel.

I received a phone call later that day. It was Andy; he had just arrived in Queenstown, no dramas, in the shitbox rental vehicle. He asked me to meet in some obscure car park on the edge of town. As I arrived I fixed my eyes on the hire car. What a terrible car; a Nissan Fairlady, born in the 1990s. Andy laughed, shook my hand and said, "let me present our chariot for the week". After pointing out the abundance of defects, he said finally “but she runs like a dream”. I imagined an episode of the classic prehistoric based cartoon, the Flintstones. Was there a huge cut-out in the driver side stair well for Andy to manually propel the car along? Andy took photos of the lake then grabbed his snowboarding gear out the boot of the car. We headed town-wards, checked into Nomads and headed immediately back out for dinner. As we walked Andy began to chat about his journey from Christchurch. Andy, an avid photographer, captured many photos of the journey on a SLR Digital Camera. He showed me a few of his favourites; there was so much wilderness (bushland), in the central region of the South Island. I was jealous of what I saw, but; I wouldn’t have missed that view of the mountain on approach to Queenstown airport for love nor money.

As we stood in the hostel lobby Andy said with a beeming smile, "I'm happy with my room matey. I've got the lower bunk of the bunk-bed. I just had a quick chat with my room-mates. The girl in the top bunk is dangerously attractive. She's blonde, fit as a butcher's dog, down to earth and from the UK." He deeply exhaled through pert lips, raised both eyebrows and started to chuckle. "Right, what shall we eat?", he said. I mentioned that I'd already eaten at Ferg Burger, and recommended he take a look.

We entered Ferg Burger after a lengthy wait. Andy’s eyes went from viewing the menu to viewing the blonde-haired lady in the queue. Two beautifully crafted, floral patterened tattoos on her exposed shoulders caught Andy's attention. I could sense that Andy admired them. He said, in a loud southern English tone, “those are a lovely pair of tats”. The admired lady immediately turned around and gave me and Andy the dirtiest of looks. She grabbed her burger and stormed out of Ferg Burger. We were left bemused. I took a few moments to think about what Andy said and how it could be misinterpreted. I said to a still bemused Andy, “do you think she may have misheard the word ‘tats’?” We both laughed out loud.

Andy and I walked down the high street to an Alpine Lodge. It was long, sporting loads of indoor bar games including a section dedicated to the American style pool tables. The bar counter was also lengthy. It had a booty of winter dark ales on draught. I asked the barmaid for drink recommendations most similar to dark, flat ales. I was familiar with the breweries associated with the beer recommendations. First up was Montieth’s, I had tasted their "Black" version in Sydney. The choice on draught was impressive, and included ones I'd never heard of: Dopplebock Winter Ale, Velvet Stout and Oak-Aged Porter. I had a shot glass sample of each. These were refreshingly carbonate dark drinks, but lacked the deep, sour flavour of UK dark ales. These beers were very strong. The alcohol content was north of 5%. It was the special edition Dopplebock Winter Ale that I settled with as my drink of choice.

With drink in hand and coordination regressed, Andy and I turned to “see the action”. In a bar dominated by pool tables, the action was a no brainer, pool. The Alpine Lodge was full of people. Its floors were covered in saw dust and its bar counter covered in de-shelled peanuts. “Wait there” Andy said. He walked over and shouted to people on one of the pool tables. I could see Andy recognised them. He said, “Hey mate, how’s it going?” to two of them, shaking their hands vigorously. Andy beckoned me and made introductions. “Dave, Steve. Steve, Dave. Dave, Jon and the rest I honestly don’t know.”, Andy chuckled. “They all replied in something approaching unison, “Hello Dave!”. Andy explained that this group of snowboarding Aussies were Johnny Sayer’s mates. Being Aussies and being of the “boarding” community, they were some of the coolest people on the planet. If they were any more laid back, they’d be horizonal. From the subsequent conversation Andy had with them, a plan had been agreed. The group were “stoked” to be heading to the slopes tomorrow and asked if we could join them.

The hostel has a store room where, the following morning, I picked up my snowboarding gear. I met Andy in the lobby. He was board-less. His equipment was “secure” in the boot of the hire vehicle. As we stepped outside the hostel we were met with clear blue skies, sunlight peering over the mountains and a shimmer from the crystal-clear waters of Lake Wakapitu. I got into the car and performed a general assessment of its interior. Andy looked at me quizzically as he tried to put car key to ignition. A turned of the key put life into the struggling, cold engine. Andy's concern turned to one of delight as the engine roared. He beat his hands down on the dashboard, “Yes!” he exclaimed with enthusiasm. Andy turned his attentions to the CD/radio player. He explained that the radio was, as he put it, f*cked. However, the CD player was fully functional. The previous customer was kind enough to leave a number of compilation discs. Andy asked me to find a CD that was unscratched. Unfortunately, there weren't many that met this requirement. Not only was the radio f*cked, but most of the CDs were scratched to f\*ck too. “Bingo! We have a winner.”, I said on finding a marginally scraped disc. It inserted into the player with the smoothness of sandpaper. After a range of device related malfunctions, the music gently played. The sound was stereo, combining one working speaker on the rear passenger and driver side. I turned the volume up to eleven. Andy and I, turned, gave each looked a puzzled look and burst out laughing. Whatever this person’s tastes were, it wasn’t mainstream. We weren't sure it popular in New Zealand either. Well, unless mainstream New Zealand music was Country and Western.

The shitbox was taking to the wintery New Zealand hills like a duck to trees. Andy was using every bit of his adolescent driving skills to get the back end of the car to sweep round the corners. As we ascended, the car was getting precariously close to the sheer drop at the edge of the road. It was especially perilous when wider cars wanted to get by on single lane roads. The disbelief turned to tears of joy as we successfully passed a vehicle. With more ascent, there was more snow and ice on the road. It got to the point where the hire car's tyres began to lose grip. To further complicate matters, there was a big sign in the middle of the road. It indicated it was illegal to continue without tyre chains.

We were so close to the slopes. We could vaguely see the ski lifts in the distance. Andy stopped the car and indicated we should drive no further. Using gravity Andy positioned the hire car into a parking spot in the far corner of a nearby bend. Safely parked, we pulled out the snowboarding gear and disbanded. As luck had it, we saw two Korean ladies struggle to drive their car up the slope. We popped over and asked if we could assist. They pointed at a pair of tyre chains. We asked if they needed help installing them. Thankfully their English was excellent and replied with a euphoric “Yes!”. The instructions on the tyre chains indicated a full set consisted of 4, we were 2 short. Thank goodness instructions were supplied. Without them our journey to the slopes would have ended there. Instead, in a matter of minutes, Andy and I had the pair of chains installed on the back tyres. For our efforts it felt straightforward to ask for a lift. What wasn’t straightforward was how we were going to install our snowboards into their humble car with us 4 in it. It was analogous to fitting elephants into a mini. We applied an "if there's a will, there's a way" attitude to the situtation. "The way" focused on reducing the blood flow to our legs and provide extra space for the snowboards. The car pulled away slowly. The chains dug in and provided much-needed traction on the ascent. Andy and I looked at each other and laughed manically at the ridiculousness of our situtation.

I’d never seen a Kea before, the only Alpine parrot in the world. It’s a lovely looking bird, speckled green with orange notes under its wings. It was interesting observing their behaviour. In their circus (a collective name for them), the way they interacted with each other indicated a high level of intelligence. Like all intelligent animals in our world. The ones that thrive are the ones that adapt. In the case of the Kea they have adapted their diet, eating all human signage and car parts. Kea have bloody sharp beaks which will rip through anything remotely soft. It was funny to see Kea warning signs defaced by the Kea.

The slopes were busy. Andy and I easily found Johnny's mates. We just headed to the nearest drinking stop. We all looked the part for snowboarding. I was dressed looking similar South Park's Mr Hanky the Christmas Poo. The rest of the group donned a variety of brightly-coloured, eye catching outfits. The chair lifts were awkward to use, especially for me who hadn’t used one for well over a year. I somehow coordinated a successful dismount, side-stepping pain and embarrassment. That's not to say I wouldn't feel pain that day. Bring on the icy conditions.

It was a bright day and the slopes weren’t particularly steep. There were a couple of route options: route one was a standard blue grade slope, the other was terrain park focused. Andy took to the park like a Kea to road signs. I, on the other hand, was much more risk averse. When I built up enough courage to try the park I was surprised how well I navigated the obstacles. As my confidence grew I began attempting more technical maneuvers. It was evident, as the day progressed, more ice was forming on the slopes. This may be fine if the slope is straight as an arrow. Unfortunately, most slopes had turns. To take on a turn, the board needed to cut into the ice. My board was blunt, whenever I attempted to turn, I fell. Falling on virgin snow is comfortable. Falling on ice really hurts. Given the number of times I fell that day, my confidence dropped and my body was in a lot of pain. In the past I snowboarded till the slope closing time. This time round, pain dictated I should stop. For me to continue on the slopes that day I would need either pain killers or a huge cup of concrete (grit). I considered the latter. After sitting down for a short period of time my leg muscles began to seize. I fretted, there were potentially 2 days of boarding left on this holiday. I carefully considered my options. Not being one to miss an opportunity, I took a dose the pain killers and slowly got to my feet.

It was a relief to finish the punishing day of snowboarding on the slopes. The punishment would continue if we couldn't catch a ride  back to our distantly parked hire vehicle. Andy’s mate’s car was packed like a mini full of elephants. There was no public transport, our only option was to hitch. The latter was going to be a new experience for me. I had an idea of how to hitch hike; stick the thumb out, look friendly and lock eyes on the person driving the approaching vehicle. Andy was versed in technique, he had much more life experience than me. As with all activities he took to hitch hiking with good humour.

We positioned ourselves on opposite sides of the icy road with a clear view of each other. Andy's more approachable demeanour (he is a good looking fellow) worked like a charm; within minutes a car came to a grinding halt just by Andy’s hitching spot. He indicated to me to get my arse over asap. The single, 20-something-year-old, local lady was a brave soul, given she was about to let two 2 randoms into her Subaru (pronounced “soo-BAAAHHHH-roo”). Given her choice of words, I could sense she wasn't a person to take advantage of. Andy and I made sure she knew how appreciative we were. The lady kicked off the small talk: “First time in Wanaka?”, “Have you been to…?”, “they say that there’s going to be a dump of snow on Monday of next week”. Conversation continued to flow, and my confidence grew. A question popped into my head. I had a burning desire to ask it, even though it bore little to the current line of questioning. It was going to be a question to shock the listener, which why I desired to ask it. Teresa and Andrew (my New Zealand friends back in Australia) were the people who would ask me at the end of a big night out, “Are you going to get your dick wet tonight?” I never worked out it's true meaning. Given we were in the company of a friendly New Zealander, it seemed the right time to ask her what it meant.

I blurted out a condensed version, “Do you know the phrase 'Getting Ya Dick Wet?'” The once jocular atmosphere turned to one of silence. Andy looked at me in disgust. The driver's head and eyes, once fixed on the road began to turn slowly toward me. My usual shy smirk was replaced with one of hang-dogedness. I thought, “oh shit what did I just say?”. She eventually replied, “what about it?” I wasn’t sure how my follow-up question was going to be structured. I hesitated, sweat began to form on my brow. I licked my dry lips and responded nervously, “well, er, my New Zealand friends used to say it to me. I didn’t know what it meant.” She sighed, “it means to have sex.” I felt like an idiot. I had a problem, I loved using shock value conversation pieces on people I had just met. I could sense Andy was burning holes in the back of my neck with his disaproving stare. The lengthy silence was broken by Andy. “Do you know of any good drinking spots around these parts?”, Andy asked. The driver looked notably more relaxed. “There aren’t that many pubs around these parts. There’s the pub at the local hostel. The best entertainment, in my opinion, is at Lake Bar.” Andy’s face lit up as he silently hatched a plan for the night’s proceedings.

We soon arrived at the rental vehicle. I broke my silence, offering sincere thanks for the lift. We waved as the Subaru sped off down the road. There was never any doubt that the rental car would still be parked where we left it. It wasn't worth much more than the fuel left in the tank.

Lake Wanaka is, in my humble opinion, the most beautiful body of water I have ever seen. Lake St. Clair in Tasmania is a close second. On that day the lake was flat as a pancake, only a gentle ripple was visible on its mirror like surface. Unfortunately, the only entertainment at Lake Bar was there weekly quiz, which was too taxing on the brain for me and Andy. We headed back for our final night in Queenstown.

The next day it was time for Andy and I to part ways. Andy had a long trip back to Christchurch. I had a long walk to the Airport. Before we said our goodbyes, Andy opened up. He was having second thoughts about his relationship with Cullen. He didn’t love her and admitted to having a wandering eye. He continued to talk about shenanigans at the hostel. “If I loved Cullen I would have stopped the conversation dead in the water, but I didn’t”, Andy admitted. He continued, "do you remember that blonde girl at the hostel. We talked openly about life. Time flew by. Before we knew it we’d been talking for 2 hours. That feeling of wanting to have sex with someone other than Cullen. It's there and it isn't the first time I’ve felt this way during my relationship with her. I need to rethink the relationship.” He shook my hand as we went our separate ways.

## Chapter 10

### The Broken Jaw Incident

On return from my New Zealand winter sports trip I was beginning to yearn a change from my Sydney lifestyle. I wanted to either move to another Sydney suburb or move to another city entirely. What would be more exciting? I decided to plan a move to another large Australian city, with assistance from the software testing consultancy. KJRA had offices in the states of Queensland and Victoria. Melbourne, Victoria was the more favourable option. It was considered globally as one of the best cities to live in. Now, the difficult part, I had to ask the question to my boss, Mark. One day in October I sent an email with my desire to work at their Melbourne office. Mark was fast to respond, within minutes of hitting the send button the phone rang. I was caught off guard by the immediacy. “Dave?” he said quizzically. “Hi Mark, did you get my email?” I replied. “Yep, that’s what I want to talk to you about. I’m happy for you join the team down in Melbourne. You must be aware that they currently have a large number of people not working for clients. Business is picking up in Melbourne, but currently it is running slowly.”, he explained. “That’s fine Mark. When would be an appropriate time to make the move?” I asked. “It's not going to be immediate. Once I know, I will give an indication of the time window.” Mark said. I felt excitement and trepidation. Selfishly I had only considered my needs. I was forgetting my friends, who were my adopted family and reason why I had stayed in Australia. I had to tell them of my plans.

Carl, and girlfriend Uma, had booked a table on booze cruise: a 3-hour harbour cruise, complete with dinner, unlimited drinks and stage-show entertainment. It was all booked through a reputable discount website. The cruise would be departing from Darling Harbour on Saturday evening in early September. Carl asked if I was interested in joining him and Uma. I said yes, without looking into the details of the trip.

I turned up to Darling Harbour as the sun was setting. Note, I was sober as a judge. I looked out and saw a hive of activity in the harbour. Boats as large as the Circular Quay to Manly public transport vessels (capacity, 400 people) began to depart, one-by-one. Each boat was full with party goers. I looked at my iPhone to find a photo of the vessel I was booked onto. I sighed. The boat had a face only a mother could love. My attention was diverted from the queue of customers to the people walking around the harbour. Under my breath I said "Where are Carl and Uma?". I did a second scan. It took me a few seconds to pick them out from the crowd. They walked languidly in my direction. Uma forced a smile and Carl looked at me with an air of disgust. “Hello dick head,” he said. Thankfully, by this stage in our friendship I was accommodating to his put-downs. I knew he cared. A grin and a hello was as good as I could muster. "Who else was coming along?", I asked. Unfortunately, out of the group of nearly 20 Brit's, only 3 of us thought this was a good idea. I began to wonder why?

There was a flicker of staff movement on our unattractive boat. Onboarding was to begin as the gang-way was lowered. The queue consisted of couples and one singleton, me. A member of staff checked our tickets as we embarked. Another looked at our ticket and  directed us to our assigned tables. My small table for one was located to the rear of the first floor balcony. Uma and Carl were assigned a large table towards the front. I waved enthusiastically; Carl lifted his head, Uma beamed, as they both sat down. I was distracted briefly as a waiter placed a bottle of red and white wine on my table. A special "all you drink", drinks menu suddenly appeared in front of me. Items included: draught, bottled beer, spirits and more cheap wine. My excitement piqued. I poured myself a glass of red, necked it. I poured a glass of white, necked it. I ordered a bottle of VB, necked that. I worked my way through the whole menu, in a western top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. The pre-ordered meal arrived just in time for the stage show to begin. At this point I was beginning to lose consciousness, given the effects of mixing grain and grape based drinks.

In my semi-conscious state, time was passing by quickly. Before I knew it, the show was over, the vessel was docked and it was time to depart. Carl and Uma walked over to my table. Uma enthusiastically asked about the show. I could not speak, such was the impact of the alcohol. Carl indicated he and Uma were heading to the James Squire Bar before calling it a night. In my agreeable and wavering state I nodded and followed the couple to the embarkation point. The fresh air hit me. I was finding it difficult to keep conscious. My focus shifted to coordinating my limbs as I shuffled down the ramp. I looked across the Darling Harbour thoroughfair. The James Squire Bar was buzzing. A group of men dressed in Mexican, Mariachi fancy dress, were stood outside. My recollection of events from that point forwards is best described as hazy. I purchased a round of drinks for myself, Uma and Carl. I looked at both of them. They were noticably drunk and tired. They left their drinks and wished me fair well.

I walked over to the group of Mariachis and we soon left. I briefly regained consciousness. A person dressed as a Mariachi asked me to hold a wedge of tissues to my jaw. He opened the passenger door to a taxi. I got in, the Mariachi instructed the driver to take me to the Sydney Hospital. The brain was not engaged. I was unaware of my injuries. I sat, slumped in the taxi seat. I pulled the wedge of tissue away from my chin. I felt the warm trickle of blood. I reapplied the tissue. The taxi driver asked if I was okay. Thankfully my senses were numbed to the pain. I indicated all was okay and asked where we were going. The alarmed driver said "we are heading to Sydney Hospital mate. Hang in there. You need someone to look at that chin."

The taxi pulled up outside the sleek looking hospital A&E entrance. I paid the driver, hobbled through the first set of doors and into the waiting area. Immediately I was attended to. A nurse asked to see a form of ID. Thankfully, I had my Medicare card in my wallet. She made a note on piece of paper and looked at my chin. “What happened to you then?” she asked. “Fell over, I think” was my belaboured response. “Remove the tissue and let me take a closer look at your chin”, she asked. The nurse looked closer and winced. “You’ll be needing stitches!” she exclaimed. “Come on though to the ward, we’ll get you a bed”, she said. The nurse sped off, returning with a large plaster that she stuck to my chin. ”There, is that better? Let me grab you a robe.” she said. A distinctive blue uniform was presented to me. The nurse allowed me privacy, pulling a set of curtains around my bed.  It was a relief removing my blood and alcohol-soaked clothes. I put the night dress on and lay in bed. I stared at the ceiling, taking a moment to think about the current situation. As I yawned and closed my mouth, my top and bottom teeth weren't stacking atop one another. I strained my right jaw muscles to correct the problem. My jaw ached attempting to keep the teeth together. I used my tongue to probe the condition of my teeth. Some were jagged, others were loose. What the hell happened to me!?

The nurse was a welcome distraction. She asked me to sit up. The plaster was gently removed from my chin, the area was cleaned and injected with anaesthetic. A plastic stitch was laced through with a large needle. The procedure was performed quickly and beautifully. A large bandage was applied over the stitching. "Please lie back", she asked. It went deathly quiet. My thoughts were “Am I okay to leave now?” The curtains surrounding my bed were flung open and quickly closed. A young, ginger haired, male nurse asked me to show my forearm. He warned me I might feel discomfort. A large needled IV drip was inserted into the arm. It didn't bother me, I had grown up with local anaesthetics given during dental treatment. The male nurse asked if I felt any discomfort other than the obvious IV puncture wound. The affects of the alcohol consumed was slowly wearing off. The pain from my leg and jaw was becoming uncomfortable. I winced, nodded my head then deeply exhaled. “Okay, I’ll apply a dose of morphine via the drip” the male nurse said. Out the corner of my eye I could see the male nurse attach something to the drip and squeeze a syringe. I felt euphoric. The pain evaporated. The endorphin rush was on a scale beyond anything I had ever experienced. I was left breathless. My eyelids became heavy. I woke up hours later. The morphine had worn off and the pain had turned up. Not only had the pain turned up, another patient had too.

There was a lot of commotion next door. My situation was clearly nothing in comparison to hers. I gathered from the conversation, my neighbour was a young party goer. She had inadvertently overdosed. The family was present, offering a prayer. Initially, it wasn’t looking good. The call of nature got the better of my noseyness. The noise from nextdoor was drowned out by the discomforting pain of my bladder. I swung my legs to the side of the bed, grabbed my mobile IV unit and flung the curtains open. After successfully locating the bathroom, I attended to number one. I looked around and noticed the many mirrors. Like an inquisitive child, I stared at myself in the mirror in front of me. It was more an an assessment, than a shallow admiration. I noticed the plaster on my bloody chin. My glasses look slightly damaged, and as I suspected, my jaw was skewed. My teeth appeared to look okay, which was a relief.

I made my way back to bed and lay there, awake, trying best to shut my eyes. I was tired, but the noise from next door and the pain of my injuries was keeping me up. The commotion from next door stopped after the patient woke up from her drug induced slumber. The only thing keeping me awake was pain. Thankfully, I passed out. The hospital became enshrined in light as the sun began to rise over Sydney Harbour. This angelic call made me stir and wince as I tried to open my eyes. The pain immediately returned. I was rested, but tired, tired of being in hospital. I had to get back home. I didn’t want Becs to be worried.

A male nurse appeared and asked "how are you feeling?". Given my desperation for a reprieve, I enthusiastically indicated I was physically and mentally awesome, never better. After asking a few questions about my health, he handed me a discharge form and said “Right, sign here and you’re good to leave!”. I was shocked, “I can go?” I thought. I sheepishly looked around. Moments later the nurse returned with my worldly possessions. They were marked with blood, dirty and abrasion. Still, I was to see the items of clothing. I changed and attempted to walk to the reception area. I could hear the clop of my hard-soled shoes as they tapped the clean, solid, hospital floor. At reception I handed over my discharge form and thanked the staff dearly for the care that they provided. The sun made me squint as I approached the large glass door exit. Once outside the fresh morning air hit. Thankfully the alcohol levels in my blood stream had subsided somewhat. Instead of accelerating my level of drunkenness it reversed it. The come-down from excess alcohol consumption is horrid. The hangover. It didn't mattered what I was going to do that day to alleviate it. It was going to affect me sooner, rather than later.

I hobbled and winced as I walked the streets of Sydney CBD. I was reacting to both the pain and the shame and my injuries. I tried to recollect what happened the night before. Unfortunately, there was too much I did not know. I could, at best, vaguely recall what happened immediately after the fall. I had a moment of inspiration. I rummaged through my pockets like a hungry ferret. I stopped and emptied all possessions from the front trouser pockets. Nothing. Coatpockets? Nothing. Back jean pockets? “What do we have here?” I whispered. It felt like a business card. I slowly extracted it from my pocket. I took a glance. "What the hell?" I said. The place name was flamboyantly styled, in gold, under a laminated exterior. I read the name, Velvet Underground. I got my phone out and Google-d it. I went to a strip club. I was happier, I knew my location between the time I left James Squire, to the time I entered the Taxi.

I returned to the Rose Bay apartment in, what felt like, minutes, but in reality was well over an 2 hours. I collapsed on the sofa in the lounge and stared vacantly at the white ceiling. I realised I was on my own. Where was Bec’s? I wanted her to know that I was okay. I played out what she would say when she saw me. “Where were you last night? You dirty stop out.”. I was a definitely a dirty stop out. I was dirty and hadn't returned home the night before.

I didn't respect myself. I was 31. I had been socially drinking ever week for over 13 years. I had been lucky with drinking related injuries, until now. This injury was to bring about change in my relationship with alcohol.

My curiosity got the better of me. I wanted to see the state of my face. I got to my feet and looked in the mirror. My chin looked like a congealed mess criss-crossed with scabs and stitching. I moved my lower jaw in a clockwise motion. It ached. My teeth still felt alien. At least my designer-ware glasses were looking as sharp as ever. I took photos of my head from various angles to ensure there were no other surprise cuts and bruises. Thankfully, the only damage was where I expected it, to my mouth and chin.

My life over the coming weeks and months was an uncomfortable one. My jaw ached. It needed closer examination by a medical professional. A phone call, a bus journey to hospital and an X-Ray later, all was clear. My lower jaw had nearly broke in half at the chin. The doctor was amazed, she pointed at the X-Ray to show a hair’s breadth of bone holding the jaw together. My teeth ached. I asked the doctor if she could take a look. She recommended I see a dental specialist immediately.

Bec’s recommended I visit her private dentist, located a couple of blocks from the flat. I booked an emergency appointment and visited the next day. On entering, I was warmly welcomed by receptionist, wife and aide to dentist, Mr Weinstien. She asked a question common at all healthcare centres, “Do you have health insurance?”. "No", I embarrasingly replied. The receptionist was surprised by my answer. Most Aussie’s had it because of the EOY tax benefit it provided. She warned that dental appointments were going to be expensive without health insurance. “Please take a seat in reception. The dentist will be with you shortly.” she said. Dentist, Mr Weinstien appeared in the waiting room and welcomed me. His positive body language was unusual, it was midday. Sweat should have been dripping from his brow and he should have looked stressed. “David?” he asked with a calm air of confidence. I smiled, got to my feet and shook his out-reached hand. The 50-something dental surgeon looked every bit the professional advertised on the plaque that donned the surgery entrance. “Come this way and take a seat in the dental chair” he said. I felt at ease. The dental chair was very comfy. He stood next to me, eyes on the computer screen, tapping away on the keyboard. He asked a standard set of questions "What is your fullname, date of birth, address including postal code...". Mr Weinstien paused and asked, “So how can I help you Mr Clarke?” I grimaced, “I recently fell and hurt my jaw. My flat mate recommended you.”, I said. “Ah, okay, well let’s have a quick look, shall we? Open your mouth as wide as you can” he asked. I tried, an inch of gap between the top and bottom sets of teeth was all I could manage. “Is that the widest you can open your mouth?” he asked with concern. I nodded. “Ok, let’s see,” he said. Mr Weinstien began to prod my teeth gently with his index finger. I could clearly feel some of my teeth moving. I indicated my discomfort with short, sharp breaths. Out of the blue Mr Weinstien said “Fuck!”. He recoiled and retracted his index finger. I felt edgy & concerned. I had never heard a dentist use profanity before. “Ok David, I’ll be blunt. It doesn’t look good in there.” I looked away as I thought about my visit to the hospital. We need to take X-Rays to better understand the state of your jaw.” He added. I walked to a booth, stood still while a device scanned my head. A few moments later the X-Rays were back-lit on the surgery wall. “As I suspected, given my initial analysis, there is major trauma here, here, here and here. Luckily, your front teeth and rear molars, which have sustained little impact, appear to be fine. What is very concerning is the state of your jaw. I don’t understand. Given the details from the X-Ray there appears to be a fracture that cuts right through the centre. Apart from the obvious broken tooth, there are a few cracks and chips that need attention.” Dr Weinstien turned off the back-lit wall and asked me to escort him back to the waiting area.

“Ok Mr Clarke”, said the receptionist. I heard a mouse click, the hum of a laser printer, followed by the rustle of paper. "How would you like to pay?” she asked. I pulled the invoice towards me and peered at the itinerary. My jaw, that failed to open wide earlier, nearly dropped, as my eyes scrolled to the bottom of the piece of paper. I uncomfortably smiled and shifted my position to get a different angle of the cost. It was still an uncomfortably high $100. I asked “er, do I get a Medicare discount?”. The receptionist smiled and said “unfortunately, we only accept private medical insurance”. I slowly pulled out my wallet and searched for mycredit card. I pulled my lips tort as I entered my card details into the machine. The receptionist tore off the receipt and handed me a copy. I awkwardly placed the receipt into my wallet. I booked a follow-up appointment to run through the "plan of action". It would mark the beginning to the end of my discomfort.

The dental consultation day had finally arrived. I was ready to follow the “plan of action”. As I waited in the dental chair for Dr Weinstein I felt positive. A plan, however long, was going to result in my life improving. “Right”, Dr Weinstien sighed heavily as he brought the X-Rays to my attention. He referred to 4 teeth; the 3 here will need to be drilled out. This broken canine… I discussed with a fellow dentist at my local pub. He advises me he to use this extraction device. It's straightforward: Lasoo tooth, tighten, the tooth should dislodge, with a velcro like action. You are looking at 2 visits. If you’d like, we can take care of the 3 molars now. The next session we can extract the canine. "My wife informs me that you don’t have health insurance?”, said Mr Weinstien. I shook my head. “These procedures will be expensive. I will try to keep the procedure time and cost to a minimum. I estimate it will in excess of AU$1000. It will be more if complications arise.” he said.

Early that morning, the consultation ended in 2 back teeth being removed. The right side upper and lower were cracked all the way through. The procedure took an hour and half. Mr "Yank 'em" Weinstien drilled and extracted as much as he could of the 2 teeth in question. Thankfully, the anaesthetic shielded me from a lot of pain. The open gum wounds were sewed using a synthetic material to help the jaw bone heal. I had several gausses placed in between the 2 bloody gaps. The receptionist handed me a shopping bag of pain killers, advising me how frequently I should take them.

I exited the dentist AU$960 down and high on pain killers. I immediately headed to work. The anaesthetic slowly wore off throughout the day. By 4pm the nerve endings in my mouth woke up. I couldn't focus. The pain for the next two days was energy sapping. It would frequently wake me up at night. Neurofen was my saving grace on many ocassions.

During the second procedure I had a $160 filling and the most intricate extraction of a canine that I have ever experienced. I’d never seen a dentist so elated by the outcome of dental work. “Wait till I tell my colleague when I next see him. I'm sure he’ll be very happy his tool was put to good use.” In the surgery room he held his mate's tooth extraction tool aloft like a winners medal. “You will need to consider future options:

1. Have nothing done.
2. Removable false teeth.
3. Permanent prosthetics.

I highly recommend Option 3. The procedure involves drilling a hole into the jaw, inserting a plug and screwing a prosthetic into it. If you do consider having prosthetics you will have to wait at least 4 months. The jaw bone needs to fully heal before any false teeth can be attached. If you do opt for the permanent prosthetics option, please be aware that you could pay as much as $4500 per tooth!”, dr Weinstien said. I took a mental picture of my bank balance and sighed. Thankfully I didn't need to consider taking action now. Could I live without prosthetics? It was too early to make that call. Now the work to remove my teeth was complete, I was looking forward to eating without discomfort. I had taken that pleasure for granted far too often in the past.

The 6-week performance testing engagement at Macquarie Bank was a short one, stressful and thoroughly satisfying. A highlight of my software testing career. Having to handle the pressures of work and the pressures of friendships was difficult. The friends that I cared for the most were: Bruce, Andy, Andi, Becs, Carl and Johnny. I still hadn't informed them of my plans to move to Melbourne. Out of respect, i wanted to tell them, one-on-one, face-to-face. I began closest to home, Becs, my flatmate. I explained in the only way I knew at the time, bluntly. I tried to sell the idea of moving to Melbourne as a means of experiencing more of Australia. She was clearly saddened by what I said, which saddened me. She explained that I had a close network of friends here in Sydney. They cared for me. She argued, why should you move when you are clearly enjoying life in Sydney? I am stubborn. When I have an my mind set on something, I follow it through to the end.

Out of the remaining close friends, Carl and Johnny were the people hit hardest by the news. Carl, in an unexpected turn, took the news with anger. I was taken aback. After thinking the situation though I reasoned it was fine to have such feelings. He had invested so much time in the relationship with me. To see that investment go bad, seeing me walk away, it must have left a bitter taste in his mouth. Johnny, a more distant friend, had feelings similar to Becs. My other friends were more forgiving. Their feelings about their futures were similar to mine. I was unaware how much people cared for me. I had been selfish. I hadn’t taken the time to consider other people’s feelings.

I reflected on my friends and family back at home and how the impact of my move to Australia must have had on their lives. To think, of all the people I knew and cared for, it was my mom who had the most interest in my life. Of everyone, it was mom who would keep me up to date with news back at home. It was mom who would Skype me every week. It was mom, I realised, who loved and supported me the most in my life.

The move to Melbourne was pencilled in. Mark called to inform me it would be Monday 1st November. I crafted an email to send my network.
“As many of you are aware I've chosen to move to Melbourne. I've set the date for the big move, it is Sunday 31st October. It would be great if you could join me in celebrating the "Passing of the Dave" on Saturday 30th October at The London Bar at 7:00pm".
With email sent, it was time to put the plan into action. I had accumulated loads of personal items:

- One king size bed with super comfy mattress and memory foam cushions.
- Side table.
- PS3
- 42” LG TV

I wondered how much it would cost to transport everything to Melbourne. The total retail value of the items was in excess of AU$1000. Van hire cost north of AU$500. The cost did not account for:

- handling of goods.
- drive time for the 900km, 600 miles journey.
- fuel.

Employing a removal company, again, would cost north of AU$500. I was out of ideas. My focus was to secure rental accommodation in Melbourne. Finding a rental property would not be a problem. The Gum Tree website had numerous listings. Unfortunately, my budget and time window was very limited. I contacted each of the five properties to determine availability. Of the five, two were still available. The first was situated in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorne. The other was located further out from the city. The Hawthorne apartment seemed the most promising, given the pictures and description. It was obvious the second property was advertised by an estate agent given the cagey communications I received to my enquiries. I wanted to use the second property as a means of leverage. There was a third property, which was taken off the market a day before my flight to Melbourne. Oh well.

In the second weekend of October I organised a fly-in viewing for both properties. Great, hopefully I’d be able to see some of Melbourne City. The schedule was tight. I had organised a day trip and return flight. I flew from Sydney International to Melbourne Tullamarine Airport. Tullamarine had excellent public transport links to Melbourne City. What was frightening was the distance the airport was from the city. The Skybus was the best value option. It offered a sublime level of comfort and entertainment to keep passengers occupied.
Melbourne, does not have the iconic sights of Sydney, but its cityscape is beautiful. As we reached our final stop in Melbourne City I sprung into action. I planned a visit to Hawthorne where I would meet potential flatmate Luncinda, an Australian of British decent. Melbourne didn't have a Metro (subway) system. Public transport included trams and trains; overground and irregular. Thankfully, Hawthorne's train station was less than 100 metres away from the rental property's locality. Unfortunately, the doors weren't numbered. I picked up the phone and called Lucinda. “Hello, is that Lucinda?”, I asked timidly. A piercing, anglicised voice replied “Yes, it is, is that David? Where are you?” she asked. I indicated I was outside. She hurridley said “It’s not easy to find this place. I’ll come downstairs and let you in.” Lucinda was a little out of breath as she opened the front door and met me on the street. She smiled nervously, introducing herself with a piercing inflected tone. “Hi, my name is Lucinda, pleased to meet you.”, she said. Her introduction was followed up with a giggle. "I can't believe you've come all the way from Sydney to Melbourne to view rental properties", she said. I was taken aback by how attractive she was: She had a beautiful figure, long black flowing hair and immaculate skin (a rarity for Australians). She seemed really nice. Why had this property listing been live on Gum Tree for so long.

I began asking questions about the tenancy agreement. She had an arrangement with the landlord very similar to Manly flat Flo's (Flo, still hadn't returned my deposit). Lucinda opened the front door. We climbed a flight of stairs. She opened the door to apartment and began describing the interior. “This is the bathroom… the lounge… the kitchen… the balcony… the bedroom available for rent.” The apartment was all open plan, modern and comfortable. The kitchen, dining room, and living room melded into one. I was impressed with the use of space. Lucinda giggled as she indicated her room. She gave the open door a firm pull to ensure its contents was out of sight. I was sold, it felt homely; it wasn’t as prestigious as the Rose Bay flat. Saying that, what accommodation offered views of something as iconic as Sydney Harbour Bridge? Lucinda's flat was close to a train station. A train ticket to the city was reasonably priced. The Rose Bay flat by comparison did have good transport links, but were much more expensive. For my first Melbourne accommodation viewing, I was happy. But, I couldn't help think I'd missed something. I asked the question to Lucinda “why is the property available?”. "The previous occupant of the room for rent was made my life hell. They did not pay bills on time. They were untidy and left without notice, owing rent", she said. She indicated that she was still chasing them for rent owed. I warmed to her heart-felt reasoning. I shook her hand, smiled and made my way to the Hawthorn train station.

I had a little time to burn before the next viewing. It was lunch time; I was a short distance from the city. I got out my 21st Century map, the iPhone, and typed in "Restaurants". The iPhone suggested directions to a pub close to Melbourne's Flinders Station. The sun bathed the landscape as I looked out of the train window. I walked from Flinders Station up the road, glancing down at my phone. The battery sign flashed and all went blank on the screen. Bugger. I Looked up and noticed loads of bars. The common deal each bar offered was "a pint and a parmigiana for AU$10". After passing pub number 10, I stopped, doubled back and entered. Now, this was a proper British style pub. It was dark, chock-a-block with bar stools. The smell of stale beer lingered in the air. It had horridly designed carpets and a letter box style bar front. I felt immediately at home. I ordered the obligatory deal, parmigiana and a pint. I set my eyes on the powerless iPhone. I walked over to the bar maid and asked “do you have an iPhone charger?” I was expecting no, but suprisingly, a resounding yes was received. I nearly wept tears of joy. I composed myself and handed over the phone. I walked back to the nearby table. A thought occupied my mind, work. Work had begun to spill into the chaos which was my personal life. I was working 12 hour days Monday to Friday to try and meet the client's delivery dates. I opened up the laptop and connected to the pub wifi. An email from the client sat in front of me asking questions about the results. I baulked, fired up the spreadsheet. Took a closer look at the numbers, calmed my thoughts and answered the queries. After 10 minutes of typing I clicked the send button and felt a huge sense of relief. I was somewhat proud of myself for going "above and beyond" the call of duty. Besides, I had one less email to concern myself with on the Monday. Win, win.

My gaze was diverted from the glow of the laptop screen to the dish that was placed next to it. I closed the laptop lid and carefully placed it in my rucksack. I slid the plate of Chicken Parmigiana into view and took a closer look. What was a Chicken Parmigiana? A thin piece of breaded chicken, a tomato-based sauce and a portion of oven cooked frozen chips. I heard so much hype about this iconic Melbourne dish. I was hungry, and duly wolfed it down. I checked the time on the wall-side clock, baulked and downed the pint. I grabbed my charged phone, swung my bag over my shoulders and headed to the high street.

I reached for my phone and fired up Google Maps. By Google’s estimation, which was usually on the pessimistic side, I would reach the viewing 5 minutes later than scheduled. No dramas, 5 kilometres and 1 hour to go. A message appeared on phone followed by the iconic iPhone ping sound. I looked at the message sender; it was the Estate Agent. I read the message repeatedly to fully grasp its meaning. It read “I’m really sorry mate, I’m not going to be able to make the viewing we have scheduled this afternoon. Really, really sorry.” I was angry, but desparate. Via text, I pleaded “As you are aware I’m heading back to Sydney this evening. I have no time today to reschedule, is there no way to make the arranged viewing?” The reply was relaxed in tone, reflecting how much the estate agent cared. “The next time I see you I’ll buy you a crate of beer.” he text.

So that was my experience of Melbourne. Did I enjoy it? …Er, yes, but, the trip lacked house viewings. Sure, Lucinda's flat was nice, but how did it compare to similarly priced Melbourne rentals? One thing that was in my favour was time. Given the house viewing cancellation, I would be able to get over to Melbourne Airport with plenty to spare. “No dramas, no worries, too easy” to quote my colleague Elliot Caldwell. I journeyed back to Rose Bay via Melbourne Metro, Skybus, Jet Airlines, Sydney Trains and foot.

On the week after my return to Sydney, my boss called with a proposition. He had great news of a upcoming role, including paid for accommodation, in Sydney. The offer was too good to refuse. I felt like the boy who cried wolf. I contacted my mates in Sydney to inform them my leaving do wasn’t going to be a leaving do anymore, just a night out. I looked at the positives. I was going to see more of Andy, Carl, Johnny and Bec's. I loved these people. I spoke to my boss again to discuss the finer details of the new role. There was still much to organise. Where would I be staying? Where would my furniture be stored? I was due to move out of the Rose Bay apartment at the end of October. Further conversations with my boss made the move concrete. Work-wise, I would finish up on the Macquarie Bank project on the Friday. Accommodation-wise, I would move into a hotel in an area named Potts Point for one week. Subsequently, I would move into guest house accommodation in an area named Glebe. Storage-wise, the removal people were scheduled to transport my furniture to storage.

The accommodation in Potts Point felt cheap. At least I had personal space. I was to be happy with the temporary inconvenience, in the knowledge I would be moving to Melbourne. The only issue was, while I stayed in Sydney I would move between many types of short-term accommodation. I began getting tired of hr moving me from pillar to post. They didn't care for quality, they cared about price and availability. I took searching for accommodation into my own hands. I found a fully-furnished apartment that was cheap, plush and available long-term. The apartment was located in another suburn named Crows Nest.

The itinerary for the remaining weeks before the move to Melbourne centred on social drinking. I was in frequent contact with Carl, Johnny and Andy to organise meetups in the suburb of Paddington, Coogee and the city. My mindset around social drinking hadn't changed following the fractured jaw incident. As the wounds healed I happily went out and got drunk. It was easy to consume large quantities of alcohol in a social setting, given all my colleagues were drinkers. One night in particular, me, Teresa, Andy, Elliot and Bruce were drinking at a bar located close to the office. It started with relaxed conversation; Bruce and Elliot made their excuses headed home. Andy, Teresa and I decided to make a session of it. Teresa talked about her sons. Both were living with the couple at their new digs. The eldest, Brad was 20 something, new to Sydney, and available to meet up. Teresa gave him a call and asked to meet up with us in the Rocks. “The Rocks” area of Sydney is the oldest European settlment. It is the most touristic and expensive retail area in all Sydney. The Rocks main road acommodated many excellent drinking establishments.

It wasn't close to pub closing time. Teresa, Andy and I were already drunk. Our next stop would be at an upmarket wine shop. It was a small place; its idea was: Pay your money, collect your tokens and exchange for samples of wine. At the time I was somewhat swayed by red wine. Each red wine was stuck to the wall along with its tasting notes. Staff members were on hand to guide us through the drinking process. The process included: smelling, swirling and down-ning. The latter I excelled at. Andy and Teresa were in their element, loving the experience. The questions they directed to the on-hand staff focussed on flavour notes I had never heard of. As a novice, I went with the flow. I was happy to try whichever red wines the staff recommended. When questioned about my thoughts on flavour, I gave a default response, “nice”. It translated to, "I don't appreciate it". Andy and Teresa purchased 2 bottles of white wine before making our way to The Rocks High Street.

Teresa's drunken alter-ego began taking charge of our drinking logistics. She strained her wine saturated vocals “Right, to the Bier Keller!”. It was a repeat episode of the booze cruise. The fresh air mixed with alcohol in the bloodstream. I found it difficult to walk straight on the cobbled streets. The entrance to the Bier Keller was unassuming. We entered and traversed the stone staircase leading to the large room below. The room had a low ceiling, it was decorated with historic placquards. This place was built soon after the arrival of the first fleet. It took focus to navigate past the tables, around the old beams, below the low ceiling and over the undulating, tiled floor. Out the corner of my eye I saw Teresa’s son Brad. He was chatting to a random gent across the table. Teresa, in her inebriated state, shouted at the top of her lungs “Brad!”. She flung her arms open, tilted her head back and rushed towards the long, bench where Brad was sat. Andy and I slowly waddled over like a couple of uncoordinated Cockatoos. Teresa embraced her son and gave him an exageratted kiss on the cheek. Brad, bemused, looked at Andy and asked, “How many has she had?”. With a glazed glance, Andy looked at Brad and shrugged.

We all gathered around the table as introductions were made. “For those who don’t know. This is my son Brad”, Teresa proclaimed. Brad nodded and looked around to acknowledge the introduction. “This is Dave, my work mate at K J Ross". I put my hand up and nodded. "This is Andy, my partner,". Andy enthusiastically said "yeah", before entering into a fit of giggles. "This is Jon, an old work mate of mine”. “Right, everyone knows who I am". Teressa looked around and asked "how do we get drinks around here?”. Brad spoke up, “It’s table service. Some bloke dressed in Lieder Hosen will turn up and take our orders.”. Sure enough, a rotund Bavarian with brown braced shorts and white shorts appeared. Teresa took charge, “shhh, I’m getting the drinks in. What does everyone want?” she asked. The drinks menu had an extensive range of beers and liqeurs. The schnapps came in a bewidlering variety of flavours to suit the tastes of everyone. We opted for a selection to share. Personally, I was excited about the dark beers section of the drinks menu. Having visited the Bavarian Beer Café many times, I knew what to order. I chose a 1 litre, "stein" of my favourite beer, Hofbrau Dunkel. It made me smile saying it. If the shared schnapps experience was bad, the taste of Hofbrau Dunkel would make up for it.

The drinks arrived quickly, delivered in a Bavarian fashion i.e., one server, holding many drinks. I caressed the stein of Hofbrau Dunkel like a baby embracing their mother's breast. 1kg of liquid and a glass weighing over twie that, it took 2 hands and a room full of focus to raise the beer to my mouth. I aimed to drink a mouthful. Unfortunately, more than that ended up on my white work shirt. Lager leaves a light stain. Dark beer, I leave that to you to work out. I wasn’t overly bothered; in fact I was quite happy with my efforts. Unfortunately, my efforts were noticed by everyone on the table. Andy, with fits of laughter, tried his best to coordinate his thoughts. “Dave, ha ha, next time you should bring a bib!”, he said. His chuckle turned into a cough, which lead to him wearing most of his beer. Like a badly coordinated tennis match, I returned a serving of laughter. Our table were in raptures. Teresa piped up “right, the selection of schnapps has arrived.”

The wooden shot-glass holders were positioned in front of us. Teresa made the first move, picking up the shot glass in front of her. She held it aloft and paused. Everyone on the table followed her lead. Teresa said "cheers". We clinked our shot glasses and  slid the schnapps down the backof the throat. I took a look at the facial expressions of each person on our table. It was one of elation. The  sweet, peach schnapps, a drink dangerously easy to consume, was admired by the group. We proceeded to consume the remaining sets of schnapps.

The pub began to fill up, much to our bemusement. A musical quartet were on stage wearing Bavarian attire, setting up their brass instruments. Excitement and anticipation filled the room as the band members began to practice. I was happily resting my chin on the Stein glass, which was partly full. Teresa swayed as she turned to face the group. Her dialated pupils indicated her drunken state. “Who wants another?” she asked. Through the haze of my vision I looked at the stein and over at Teresa. I slurred as I spoke “yeah T, another dark’n, por favour.” I said effortfully. Teresa swung her arms and clicked her fingers to get the attention of the serving staff, The round of drinks took a while to order, given the encumbered mental states of people. The drinks arrived speedily, just in time for the first tune to be played by the on stage band.

Every spot at a table was now filled by a person mesmerised by the music. We swayed in unison as the “umm paa paa” rhythm took hold. We all applauded as the first song came to a close. The started playing the second song. I recognised it instantly. "Pennsylvania Polka", which featured in Bill Murray's Ground Hog Day. I went to great lengths to show my appreciation for the song. The may have been intoxicated, but I could follow the rhythm and attempt to sing along. The problem was, I never learnt the lyrics. The best I could do was attempt to match the intonations. I felt like a baby communicating my feelings to an adult. Thankfully I didn't cry in a fit of frustration. A member of serving staff, dressed in Lederhosen approached our table with gusto. He smiled, with a thick German accent he asked “Are you German? You know this song, right?” To be mistaken for for a fellow Bavarian. This was praise of the highest order. I replied honestly, “I heard it on Bill Murray's Ground Day.” With that the staff member scooted off to take drinks orders from another group.

I pushed my chair back and directed my cheerful, but harsh, singing voice at the rest of our group. Teresa laughed, "Dave, you crack me up." amusement. To complement my merriment everyone in our group stood up and swayed with me. As the song ended I held onto the last note and collapsed back into my seat. I was finding it difficult to keep awake. “Right”, Andrew said, attempting to lead the rest of the group. “Onwards to Argyle!”, he exclaimed.

The Argyle, located just around the corner was distinctly trendy. A bar where Australian celebrities were, on the ocassion, to be found. As we queued I was aware of the many bouncers. They looked at me with disgust. Thankfully I was still conscious. I did my best to appear sober for the brief time that we queued. “How ya going? Had a good night so far?”, bouncer-one asked. “Looks like you’ve had a good night so far?” bouncer-two added. Teresa piped up, in a commanding and serious tone she replied. “Yep, been great so far, it’ll be better when we get in. It’s bleedin’ freezing out here.” The bouncers were taken aback by how confident and outspoken she was.Like a defeated army, the bouncers waved their white flags. The triumphant Teresa confidently turned to us and proclaimed, “come on then, remember I’m buying.” The serious tone once again turned jovial as a smile beemed across her face.

I walked over to the nearest table and took a seat. My body slowly crumpled onto the table. “Right mate, you need to put some strength into those legs else we’re not going to be able to carry you.” A voice said. In my semi-conscious state I looked around and noticed two big blokes, one eitherside of me. It took a few seconds for my brain to work out what was going on. I blindly tried to follow their instructions. After making my way through the entrance archway to the street outside I was gracefully laid down. “Mate, best advice, take a taxi home” the bouncer instructed. I slurrily retorted, “but my mates are in there.” I didn't care much about returning and I didn't care much for a taxi. Even in my drunken state I was tight on the purse strings. I needed to find the bus home. Having recently moved to new accommodation I couldn’t determine where home was. I managed to get to my feet and walk to the high street where I saw a fleet of buses. I took a hard look at the lengthy queue that had formed at bus stop one. I concluded length of queue equals correct destination. As I entered the bus I fumbled for cash and grabbed a ticket. There was a free seat near the front. I collapsed into the seat and passed out.

I jolted and gained consciousness as the driver tapped me on the shoulder. “Last stop mate” he said in a relaxed tone. My state of mind was a little clearer at that point. I was able to assess my surroundings and direct a question to the driver “where am I?” The driver indicated a suburb that I had never visited before or since. The driver asked “where do you need to get to?” I paused and thought for a lengthy period of time for an answer. The picture of a crow appeared in my mind. "What does that mean? Yeah, I remember,Crows Nest” I blurted. “Jeez mate, you’re a long way from home. I’m heading back into the city after a short break here. It’s best if you stay on this bus and take a taxi when you get into the centre. There aren’t any buses heading that way at this time of night” he instructed. With that I got to my feet, stretched and exited the bus.

The overwhelming urge to defecate distilled my thoughts. "Is there a toilet nearby?", I asked the driver. "Nah mate, there are some bushes over there if you're desperate?" he replied calmly. I couldn't work out where "over there" was. I looked at my surroundings like a moth searching for the nearest light source. I could only see the entrance lights of nearby homes. The idea of knocking on someone’s door and asking to use their bathroom at gone midnight. As great as the end results was, there was the possibly of someone taking offence to me waking them up. I looked further afield. In the depths of darkness I saw a flower bed. A befitting area for human fertilizer i thought. Going for a number 2 in the wild can be treacherous. Even in a sober state, the squat position is not the easiest to coordinate. Getting the non-essential clothing out the way and the clean up task at the end could also prove difficult. When performed correctly, the squat is more satisfying than a sit-down. I went through the motions of the former with meticulous detail. What made the whole exercise a damn sight easier, was a fence. It allowed for a more stable perch. As I squatted, I clasped the metal bars firmly. A huge sigh of relief and a smile followed.

With a load off my mind I swaggered jovially towards the bus. I hopped onboard, sat down and smiled once more. The silence and darkness of the interior was replaced with the flicker of internal lights and roar of the bus engine. As I headed citywards I was happy to be sobering up, unharmed and heading home.

## Chapter 11

### The Boys Weekend

Johnny did a bloody good job of organising it all for mid-October. : The accommodation in a Surfers Paradise resort for 13 of us for 2 nights. Unlucky for some, you could say. AU$100 bond was required for each room. The hotel had gathered it was a “lads holiday”. I was to share a room with my best friend Andy.

Surfers Paradise was renown for being a destination where college students would flock to after finishing their exams. They would, like all teenagers, make mistakes under the influence of alcohol. It was also renowned for being edgy, violent scenes could break out quickly. There were people that went to Surfers looking for trouble. The main boulevard was filled with pubs and clubs. It was a place where people under the influence of alcohol could be found.

On arrival to Surfers Paradise we threw our weekend apparel into our assigned hotel rooms and made our way to the hotel lobby. The plan, to visit many bars and drink over the course of the day. This is commonly known as the “all-dayer”. I was cautious of the "all-dayer" idea, especially after the “Darling Harbour” incident, but I thought it would still be a good idea. There was a split in the group’s thoughts on the days itinerary. On the one side was “The Johnny All-Day-er”, on the other was “The Carl Adventure Park Day-er”. I wasn’t a huge fan of either choice. I made a last minute “3 amigos” check just as “The Johnny All-Day-er” group was departing. Wallet, keys, phone… Phone!? Bugger, I pictured my only means of communicating lying on the bedside table. I rushed to my room, forgetting to mention my brief disappearance to the rest of the group. I returned to lobby to find Johnny's group were gone. Thankfully Carl and Matt were still waiting for their taxi. I took another sweeping look at the lobby space. “Where is the rest of the group?” I asked. “They went off in taxis a few minutes ago," Matt said. Carl added, "They didn’t know if you were joining them, so they took off. Feel free to join us at the adventure park if you’re stuck for anything to do.”. I was grateful for the invite, even though it wasn’t my original choice.

The taxi eventually arrived at our hotel to our relief. The three of us piled in and off we went. The taxi ride took us across a landscape far different to the one I had experienced in Sydney. Surfers Paradise, aka Surfers', was more tropical than its southern cousin Sydney. Banana plantations and swamps passed us by. The heavy rainfall had sculpted its red soils. Even though it wasn't wilderness, it still felt wild. The Warner Brothers Movie World appeared out of nowhere. The synonymous Warner Brothers logo was displayed on an art deco style arch that befitted a studio more than a theme park. Seeing the logo filled my childhood heart with joy. I was brought up on classic Warner Brother cartoons. I have much to thank them for the memories. With a sense of indebtedness, I was happy to fork out the stupidly high ticket price. Carl had a larger investment in the franchise than me, he paid extra for an "additional access" ticket.

It was surreal walking the fake Warner Brothers Movie World streets. Families walked around, entertained by individuals dressed up in Warner Brother character costumes. Shops selling a wealth of overly priced, branded confectionary were strategically positioned for maximum marketing reach. We looked out of place. Three, thirty something year old blokes were walking around a place that targetted afluent moms and dads. Carl, in his usual downbeat, sarcastic manner asked me and Matt, “so what shall we do then? And don’t think about that?” he indirectly indicated. “What?” Matt and I replied. “There is a lot of jail bait around these parts. Don’t let your eyes wander.”, he added. Teenage Australian girls wore very little, which was not surprising given the warm conditions. In an adult, social context, their clothing could be precieved as "sexy". Why didn't society frown upon it? It was something Australian cultural would need to assess.

We averted our eyes to the more epic side of the theme park, the roller coasters. The older I got, the more thrills I seeked and more impatient I became. I looked for a ride with a queue offering sub 5-minute wait times. The ride that met this requirement was the Superman Escape. It looked like a standard roller coaster: It had loops and bends. My expectations, given my initial assessment, were low. Carl, Matt and I sat in the roller coaster passenger train. The holster bars dropped down, secured and the count down was announced through huge speakers. “There's a count down?!” I surprisingly said. Given my experience of rollercoasters in the past, the first few moments of a roller coaster ride were relaxed, steady and often bumpy. This wasn’t going to be the case on the Superman Escape. Not expecting something that added to the experience brought a smile to my face. I participated in voicing the count-down, much to the amusement of Carl and Matt.

If I knew of the hype surrounding this ride, I would have known the best moment of the Superman Escape experience would be after the count down. I was innocently at its mercy. As the countdown completed, there was a short pause. My heart raced in anticipation. The roller coaster passenger train went from stationary to quick in seconds. I felt a rush of blood towards the back of the head as my skull was firmly planted against the seat headrest. The skin on my face stretched and morphed as the car accelerated forwards. My brain had little time to contemplate what it was that I was experiencing. As the acceleration eased, the endorphin rush kicked in. I was in ecstacy. The ride shortly came to an end as it continued through its twist and turns. As the train slowed and the safety bar was released, I sat there. My eyes were wide open and my heartpounded. A staff member asked me politely to exit the ride. My facial expression indicated my current state of mind. I broke my forward gaze, looked down and shook my head. I slowly got to my feet and exited into the sun baked Warner Brothers Movie World streets. My mind began to recount everything that happened during the Superman Escape experience. I began to smile. I turned and witnessed the ride as a spectator. Strangely, nothing in my mind married up with the what I saw. I stood there, bemused.

My attention was distracted by a familiar voice, “Dave!”. I turned and saw a jovial Carl and Matt. They were munching on chocolates bought from one of the over-priced confectionary shops. I looked agast at the confectionary. The first question that came to mind was “how much did you pay for that?” I braced myself for a response. “Just a couple of bucks” Carl quipped. He turned his attentions to his mobile phone. “I've just had a text from Johnny. Him and the lads are over at the Wet ‘n’ Wild. He was asking about our whereabouts. Wet and Wild, what do you think?”, Carl asked. I was, as was the case with excursions organised by other people, happy to go with the flow. The distant look on the faces of Carl and Matt indicated they didn't care. Our Warner Brother passes allowed us entry into Wet ‘n’ Wild, so it wasn’t going to be financially taxing. The Wet 'n' Wild was close by too. We agreed, for the sake of group unity, to meet Johnny and the rest of the posse.

Wet ‘n’ wild was nothing over and above other waterparks. What it did have, given the its tropical location, was heat, sunshine and high UV. We showed our passes, entered and headed over to the main pool. This is where most of the water slides were to be found. Johnny was the first to recognise us. His lairy southern accent could be heard above the sound of splashing water. “lads!”, he said. We looked up and saw Johnny in his damp, baggy trunks looking a bit worse for wear. We walked over to him. “Don’t ask. Well do, but the answer is going to be:

1. re-apply sun cream
2. don’t wear sunglasses while tackling the rubber ring water slide.
3. don't drink and slide
” Johnny said. The rest of the lads looked rested. They inteligently decided to sleep on shaded sun loungers, saving themselves for the night ahead. Johnny added that the group were ready to leave soon. They wanted to get back to the hotel, get changed and freshen up before going back out. I couldn’t speak for Carl and Matt, but I was tired and happy to head back to the hotel. “Well, I’m tired from all the standing and queueing I’ve experienced today” Carl said. Matt and I concurred. Carl continued, “Right, we’ll see you back at the hotel Johnny.”

The night kicked off, as it did in the morning, with the expat team assembling in the hotel lobby. After a quick chat with the group it was decided we would take a relaxed drinking approach to the night ahead. We walked down the high street and found a bar with an outdoor seating area. It had comfy chairs placed around many tables. A number of the lads were nervous. Their other halves had explicitly told them what they can and can't do on this trip. They looked around sheepishly, half expecting the lady in their life to appear out of the blue and wave an index finger. Many who had long term relationships e.g., Andy, Johnny and Carl, seemed the most at ease. Carl, known for his womanising, jocular comments, had one eye on his drink and another on any unsuspecting female passer-by. There was an intensity to his degrading, womanising comments that added to their comical nature. He wouldn’t dare comment in the same manner in the presence of Uma. In that situation he preferred to praise his girlfriend. But, he subtly hinted to his male friends that whatever was occupying his view was, to use a culinary analogy, delicious. Around the lads, he would add mannerisms to assert his male, testosterone driven urges. Sniffing the air and gesticulating with his tongue were hallmark Carl-isms. I laughed along at Carl’s antics, even though I felt uneasy with his behaviour. His humour was typically British, with an added rudeness that Aussies appreciated. Andy was giggling along like a Hyena, which added more punctuation to Carl’s jokes.

Johnny, the self assigned group leader, was deeply involved in conversation with his friends. He appeared uneasy. Understandable, given his group leader role. Finding the correct moment to move to the next pub is an art. I think most of us could have sat at the table until closing time, such was the relaxed environment. Johnny had other ideas, his ideal night wasn’t a relaxed one. He wanted to experience the high energy of the night club. Johnny got to his feet, rubbed his hands and exercised his jaw muscles. “Right lads! Drink up, we’re moving.”, he said. “Where to?” Carl frustratingly replied. “Well, we could sit around here, scratch our arses and make it back to the hotel. OR we could liven the night up and get our boogy on at some debaucherous club setting.” Johnny retorted. I read Carl’s frustration like a sentence of facial braille. The rest of the group looked towards Carl, “Come on Carl, it won’t be that bad.” Andy advised. Carl looked to me, quickly looked round, then whispered his intended next move. “There’s a descheveled strip club that I saw a couple of blocks away, what do you say...”, he said. He winked, and gesticulated sex. I felt indebted to Carl. He’d been the most reliable mate I knew in the short time I had been in Australia. I made the choice to abandon the rest of the group, even if it meant upsetting them. This was more preferable than upsetting Carl, that I knew hated the club scene and was forthcoming with his feelings. Johnny didn’t seem too bothered by Carl’s abhorrence.

Johnny and Carl amicably went their separate ways. Having only consumed a few beers we were all but sober by the time we got to the entrance of the gentlemen's club, Silks. Like many strip clubs in the UK, the entrance was unassuming. There was very little to indicate the shenanigans that went on behind these closed doors. In many ways it added to the tease that these dives portrayed. We made our way past the bouncers and immediately into the dark reception area. It was here that a frantic and confident lady asked us for id and entrance fee. I could sense that Carl was excited. A rush of blood made Carl more charitable. He was happy to pay my entrance fee. I looked towards the set of doors that separated us from the bar area. As Carl and I carefully opened the set of doors, we looked at each other, towards the empty stage and then towards the empty bar. “Right, let’s get royally ratted!” Carl exclaimed. I smiled, nodded and accompanied him to the bar area. “2 Yaeger bombs please” he said to the bar staff. They arrived swiftly. We clinked and consumed. After the fifth round of Yaeger bombs, the mood changed. It was like a scene in Michael Jackson’s Moonwalker movie/music video. Michael steps into the club, stops, flicks a coin into the jukebox coin slot and the dancefloor action begins.

The dancer’s stage lit up like a Christmas tree. The modern, upbeat music pounded, vibrating the whole club and its inhabitants. My eyes focussed on the criss-cross of multicolour orbs that scanned the dancefloor. This was the first tease; making the punters purposefully wait. It felt like an eternity, but then, like magic, there she was. Being sexually attracted to curvaceous women with large breasts, I craved for her. Unfortunately, the size of the dancer's breasts encumbered her routine. I turned to Carl, smiled and nodded, indicating I was enjoying the show. He looked at me with wide eyes and gesticulations. I laughed and drew my attentions once more to the dance floor. When the act finished I could see she was walking towards us. I glanced at Carl, looked in the show girl’s direction and said “I need to get a private dance with her”. I quickly got her attention and abrupt said, “Hey, private dance? How much?”. I hadn’t been so concise in my life. She replied with a prices relating to three time options: short, medium, long. I demanded the lengthiest.'

As I handed over the money, she asked me to sit back and relax. Out the corner of my eye I watched her undress. Carl walked by, hand in hand with another show girl. GG, probably a reference to her bra size, forced her enormous breasts into my face. Knowing how strip clubs operate, I knew to look but not touch. It was difficult. I was aroused. I touched GG carefully, caressing her breasts with the precision of a microbiologist. Thankfully there was no resistence. I knew it was a tease, but it was one of most stimulating I had experienced in my life. I had to curtail my sexual intentions and treat GG as a I would any professional who had their breasts planted against my face.

When the strip tease finished I walked contentedly to the bar area to see if I could find Carl. I chuckled; he walked past me again, hand-in-hand, this time with show girl number 2. I ordered a beer and looked towards the dance floor. I assessed the breadth of “talent” that walked on stage. My expectations were surpassed by the private dance with GG. I could have gone back to the hotel happier. But I wasn't going to leave without the good ship Carl. He was still pre-occupied. My drink was reaching the dregs stage as Carl returned. He had a big smile plastered across his face. "I'm knackered", he said, nodding and winking, "Fancy making a move?”.  A common event at the end of a night out, was a visit to the kebab house. Thankfully, Surfers Paradise catered for the late-night-eat-seeker's needs with an abundance of high street takeaways. Given the early hours and number of drunk people on the streets, it was always going to be a dicey. Carl and I witnessed random fights break out. Their ferocity took us by surprise. We thankfully avoided the mele, but couldn't avoid kebab sauce on our attire.

With luggage assembled in the hotel lobby, the group members looked disheveled and disappointed. There were, according to the wise words of Johhny, a lack of drinking holes and talent. Johnny's group also witnessed a large number of trouble makers on the streets of Surfers. On hearing of Johnny’s uneventful night out, I felt satisfied. Carl and I had chosen a better late-night option, albeit being a seedier one. Carl and I glanced at each other and smirked like immature school boys. Johnny turned to me and Carl, “How was your night?”, he asked. Carl looked like a cat that had the cream. Using subtle British sarcasm he downplayed the experience, “It was alright”. Carl turned to me, tapped the side of his nose with his index finger and said quietly "what happens on tour, stays on tour.”

## Chapter 12

### Smiffy and Kris Visit

Much was up in the air with regards to life in Sydney come November. I was still waiting for Mark to authorise the move to Melbourne. I was living in accommodation across Sydney. My living arrangements stabilised after I sent an email to my employer begging for serviced apartment accommodation. With my home in place, the next major event was the arrival of my mates from the UK. Matthew and Kris were all set to visit on November 22nd. They were considering a move to the Netherlands after visiting me.

It had been months in the making. Before Matthew and Kris arrived, we organised an itinerary for an epic Western Australia road trip. It start in Broome on November 26th and end in Perth 2 weeks later. I hoped by the time they arrived the Serviced Apartment Accommodation would come through. There were no new client opportunities at the consultancy in November, across all offices. It was noticeably an issue. Mark, Chief Operations Officer, dialled in from Queensland to give his weekly consultancy update. Every consultant in Melbourne, bar one, wasn't working for a client, my soon to be new home.

We didn’t have many consultants here in Sydney. This took the pressure of Bruce, the regional salesman. Elliot, the Sydney Sales Assistant and general dogs-body, was always in a client role. He and new senior consultant Jason, were making waves over at Commercial Bank Australia. Mr Playford had left the company. Only Andy Schevchenko, an Australian citizen of Ukranian descent, and I weren't working for a client. There were rumours of a big project. This was a piece of work that was initiated by Bruce, having a contact at the potential client site, and Teresa, who drove the Test Strategy. There was a lot going on in November with regards to friends in Australia and in the UK. Tony, a close friend of mine was in the process of organising the stag do (bucks party) for another close friend of mine, Rob. I was asked, by Rob, if I wanted to be joint best man alongside Tony. I declined this responsibility given my Australian location. I also had to decline the invite to Rob's stag do.

Matthew and Kris sent over details of their inbound flight. It was due to arrive in Sydney Airport on Saturday 20th November and return December 13th. We would all depart from Perth Airport, Western Australia. Matthew and Kris's flight to and from the UK was going to be an epic one, 20 hours each way. The day came when my good friends were arrived at Sydney Airport. At the time I was working on the big project, over in a suburb of Pyrmont. The client's working schedule was thankfully relaxed. A look online confirmed Matthew and Kris’s flight was on time. I was all set to meet them, making the convenient, but pricey, train journey to Sydney Airport. I found the arrivals area. I looked at the arrivals board with concern. I reconciled the flight information on the board with that on my iPhone. Yep, the fight had landed. I peformed a rough calculation, given my experience of the Sydney arrivals process; they would be through customs and baggage reclaim, without hold-ups, in 15 minutes. I felt nervous as I waited in the “welcoming party” section of the arrivals area. A set of doors flung open, a rush of passengers with luggage trolleys emerged. For that moment, as I scanned the group, I couldn’t see Matthew or Kris. Then, out of the blue, I set my eyes on them. I released a huge sigh of relief. I relaxed and  presented an open posture. Matthew approached first with a huge smile on his face. He looked knackered. “Alright mate” he said as he carefully shook my hand. Kris looked a little fresher. She gave me a hug, which I warmly accepted. I looked at their weighty luggage and asked if I could help. They were happy to lug it around. As host, I wanted Matthew and Kris's holiday to be a permeation of perfection. If it meant carrying them and their luggage on my back like an encumbered camel, so be it.

“Right, lead the way?” Matthew enthusiastically asserted. I was familiar with Sydney Airport. “Follow me” I said, looking up at the signs directing passengers to the train station. I used travel small talk to keep my friends at ease. “How was your flight?” “Did you get much sleep?” I asked. "Not much, the in-flight entertainment was cool though. What did we watch?". Kris idley mummered "Yeah, ....", her words indiciferable. I politely nodded, adding "good to hear". On the long walk to the train station I explained, "to use the Sydney Airport Train Station you have to pay a toll, which the government uses to pay for the money owed for its construction.". Stupidly, I wished I had warned them prior to their visit, to set their expectations. I was to find out that Kris and Matthew were on a tight budget and this unplanned fee was unnecessarily early in their trip. I should have paid for it on their behalf, but I was miserly. My tired and frustrated friends belligerently paid the fee and followed me to the train bound for Sydney CBD. I tried to stay ambivalent while my angry and tired friends slumped their luggage on the floor. Kris uttered something angrily under her breath. I felt uneasy. I took a looking at the electronic board to guage when the next train was due to depart.  Unfortunately, the next train was 15 minutes away. As Kris and Matthew looked onward, I took a look at my iPhone to distract my attentions away from the unease. Coincidentally, an email appeared in my inbox. It was from Carl; he asked if the ex-pat group would like to meet up at The London Pub in Paddington. I smiled as I read the finer details. The night out would keep my friends entertained. I hoped news of this would break the tension that formed between myself, Kris and Matthew. I looked up from my iPhone. I asked Matthew and Kris if they were interested in a night out involving my ex-pat friends. Matthew, being a socialite, was keen. Kris, unenthusiastically “baa-ed” her approval while looking sheepishly down at her feet.

I looked up at the on-screen train timetable. The 15-minute wait was a more digestable 2-minutes. The sound of the doubledecker train echoed as it made its way to our platform earlier than scheduled. I felt relieved. The impressive double decker train was modern. A fleet of double decker trains were purchased in 2000 to accommodate the many tourists arriving for the Olympics. Cash from the Olympics funds was used to improve the poorer suburb of Homebush, which funnily enough would become a residence of mine as the move to Melbourne debacle ensued.

We approached Wynyard Station. I looked over at Matthew and Kris. Jet lag and a dose of Sydney summer heat had caught up with them. They were say together, eyes closed, mouths open and bodies lifeless. I smiled, but knew my original plans of going for drinks would need to be delayed until they had reseted. Only one connection remained until home, Crows Nest. The train journey into Crows Nest was an impressive one by any city's standards. The Sydney Bay area is arguably the prettiest and most iconic view to grace any city. Even though Matthew and Kris were tired I could see their eyes flicker as we passed through Sydney Harbour Bridge. Funnily enough, given how often I had experienced this journey, I took it for granted.

I was happy I had apartment accommodation to use while my friends were here. It would afford Matthew and Kris the privacy and space they needed while they acclimatised. I opened the front door and waved my arm in the direction of the bedroom-come-lounge-come-kitchen-come-living room. It was clean as a whistle thanks to the recent visit by the cleaners. I had placed many touristy flyers on the dining table that offered tours during their stay. As host, I wanted Matthew and Kris to experiece maximum comfort. I let them use my double bed. Hopefully it was comfortable enough for a good days sleep. I handed the spare key to them, wrote down my phone number and said that they should call me if they needed anything. I made a beeline back to work, making sure I did my hours.

The day at work was a blur. I thought about the well-being of my friends and not the job at hand. I still felt bad about the Sydney Airport Train Station debacle. My iPhone sounded as a message from Matthew arrived in my inbox. Matthew mentioned that they felt somewhat rested and wanted to meet up with me when I finished work. He asked "where would be a good place to meet?". Given work's  proximity to Darling Harbour it would be stupid of me not to recommend its finest bar, The James Squire Brewhouse. I knew the place well. The last memory I have of it was hazy and included people dressed as Mexicans.

James Squire Brewhouse was packed on the evenings. It was no surprise given its mix of large-screen-live-sporting-events and its huge range of beers. They served many speciality beers. The one that interested me was a stout. It was the closest Australia had to Guinness. With Sergio Leon's "The Good the Bad and the Ugly" movie theme tune playing in my head, I ambly texted back to Matthew. I asked to meet outside The James Squire.

I crossed the bridge that led from Paramatta to Darling Harbour. The sun twinkled on the velvety surface of the undulating sea. The comfortable, humid, heat of the day was radiating from the brick-covered walkway. I looked over at the James Squire Brewhouse. I admired its open, commanding view of the harbour. I took a good look outside and in, Matthew and Kris weren’t around. A message tone from my iPhone confirmed their late arrival. Coordinating themselves in the haze of the post flight jet lag must have been an exhaustive effort. I was happy to wait. I ordered a schooner of the James Squire Stout and nursed it in the comfort of the outdoor seating area. The red of the sun’s rays reflected off the water and onto my face. I was forced to reach for my sunnies, which I had ready atop my head for this frequent situation. With the Oakley’s doing a splendid job, filtering out the harmful rays, I was once again able to relax. As I stretched my neck I saw a familiar couple walking towards me. Matthew and Kris looked much more responsive, having showered and changed into their summer wears. I could see a hint of a smile appear across Kris’s face for the first time. I smiled in reciprocation. I stood up tall to stretch my back, having assumed a poor perched posture. I asked them a “does Dolly Parton sleep on her back?” question. “Would you like a drink?” I said. Matthew was knowledgeable of Australian drinks. Unfortunately, the Brewhouse only had speciality beers. Kris, having lighter tastes, was happy for me to suggest a beer for her. Matthew, on the other hand, was mesmerised by the beer selection and wanted something a little more like lager. I knew exactly what to order.

We took our drinks to an outdoor table where we could stand, people watch and absorb the last rays of the dipping sun. It was some life that I was leading. There was little better in life than a social drink in dry, warm conditions against the backdrop of the sea. I asked Matthew and Kris how they were feeling. They replied energetically; a far cry from the sapped couple I picked up from the airport. I was as equally excited about Matthew and Kris enjoying themselves as I was about our holiday to Western Australia. We ambly sipped our drinks and chatted about their plans for the rest of the week in Sydney. A visit to the Blue Mountains was on the cards for the next day.

Kris and Matthew returned to the apartment from their day trip. I happily returned from a yawnful day at work. The highlight of that day was an email from Andy. He and girlfriend Cullen planned to visit the Coco Cubana for dinner prior to meeting Carl and co at The London Pub in Paddington. I was up for it, Andy and Cullen were valued friends of mine. Unfortunately, Matthew and Kris didn’t have the same enthusiasm as me, having spent the day spending ample sums of their money on tourist trap retail. Matthew, Kris and I went to a nearby supermarket and picked up a wealth of fresh food to prepare back at the flat. Queensland Mangos were in season. They were very cheap, huge, sweet and very juicy. Being quite large I brought only a couple back for us to eat. The dinner main was a chicken salad: lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and the salty tasting Coles Cooked Chicken. The day trip had worked up Kris and Matthew's apetite. It didn’t take us long to consume the banquet. We showered, changed and began the journey to The London Pub. With it being a comfortable, beautiful day, getting around Sydney was a pleasure. I was slightly nervous taking my “old friends” to meet my “new friends”.

Playing host is tiring, especially if, like me, you constantly worry about your guests wellbeing. Having caught up with Matthew and Kris’s life story over the past couple of days I was now asking questions to keep the conversation flowing. I looked out the bus window as we journeyed to Paddington. When the conversation between Kris, Matthew and I subsided, my mind was consumed by random thoughts. I could have shared these thoughts with my friends, but didn't care about their responses. My reflection in the bus window caught my attention. I noticed I was looking tired. Being forced to squint didn’t help as the sun hovered above the horizon. Anxiety took hold as I looked down at my iPhone to see where the bus was on its route. Another 10 stops, 5 minutes. Random thoughts took hold again; I looked down at my iPhone again, “shit, this is our stop” I said as I clambered to hit the bus's passenger stop button. I indicated departing to Matthew and Kris.

Matthew and Kris smiled as we exited the bus. They followed me, the navigator, eyes deep in Google Maps. I spoke out loud as I gestured our locality on the digital map relative to the The London Pub. We walked up the hill and crossed the road. It was a relief to see the red brick, black wood on whitewall façade of the pub. It wouldn’t have look out of place in any town in the UK. We entered; the familiar looking British pub interior was aparent. Wooden stools lined the bar area. Cushioned wooden benches were positioned in the corners of the lounge next to a decorated fire place. It was a comforting bosom, familiar, a great venue to aquaint Matthew and Kris. It was apparent that my ex-pat mates had commandeered a good portion of the lounge. I looked over to see Cullen, Andy, Johnny, Carl, Uma and few of their attachments. I smiled as we walked over.

Carl, the astute socialite, took the lead with welcoming Kris and Matthew to the group. “Pleased to meet you” he said enthusiastically. He had an uncomfortably smug smile on his face. It was a side of Carl I remember experiencing when I first met him over in Manly. He began introducing the group to Kris and Matthew in a smooth, open manner. “Cool” I thought, my friends are occupied, time to get the drinks in and relax. Thanks Carlos, you beauty. I asked the group, as British convention dictates, if anyone wanted a drink. Looking at the quantity of liquid in people's drinking vessels, they had arrived shortly before us. Andy though was thirsty. He indicated his schooner was in need of refilling. He looked at me and said “go on then, I’ll have another Becks.” “Anyone else?” I said. There was silence. I turned to my friends, "fancy heading to the bar to see what you'd like to drink?" I asked.

There was more than a hint of familiarity to the choice of beers on tap: Becks, Budweiser, Guinness, Speckled Hen. Being a fan of British real ales, I yearned for Speckled Hen. Matthew and Kris were being adventurous, opting for a refreshing Australian beer. “One Speckled Hen, a VB, a Becks and a Toohey’s please?” I said to the bar man. Matthew, Kris and I made our way to the comfy benches with drinks in hands. Matthew and Kris, being our guests, were allocated the comfyest seats. The group, with its members being so transient, quickly adopted Kris and Matthew as new members of the group. The conversation was high-brow too, which somewhat surprised me, given Carl's instinct was to talk in a derogatory manner. It was great Uma was on hand; she was great at censoring any “off-piste” comments that Carl could possibly say. Carl was a literary genius and well versed in dictating the ebb and flow of chat within a social group. After saying something controversial in the presence of Uma, he would turn to her, smile and smother her with gratitude.

The flow of conversation was relaxed. The people that were present simply got on. Thankfully the controversial ex-pat members were absent. My recent flatmate Becky was not one to cross. She may have been diminutive in size, but authoritarian in stature. She, like Carl, was a master of social interactions. Becky had a good grounding in HR. She was able to read a situation and apply her vast experience to produce an effective outcome. Becky was a Public Relations Manager for Sony Entertainment Australia. Her role, unfortunately, meant she was required to attend product launches, which often fell outside working hours. She was a great friend to have and an asset in all social situations. It was rare that she was available for ex-pat gatherings.

I felt really comfortable during this get-together. I could see Matthew and Kris were relaxed and enjoying themselves. Their happiness drove my happiness. The night was drawing to a close quickly, as great nights do. It was time for Kris, Matthew and I to bid farewell.As we walk back to the train station Matthew and Kris complimented me for having such an awesome group of mates. They were right, but they weren't Doug, Tony, Matthew or Rob, my best mates from home. The ex-pats were awesome, but they still felt like surrogates. I tersely tried to explain that to Matthew and Kris, which left them feeling incredulous. It had only been a year since I last spent quality time with Matthew and Kris. Yet my relationship with them felt as close as it had ever been. We still shared common interests, the main ones being: social drinking, rock music, travel & the great outdoors.

I had finished up at work. All the items I owned were packed away. Matthew and Kris had their holiday baggage repacked. Our next destination wasn't Western Australia, it was Victoria, Melbourne to be more accurate. Melbourne was on Matthew’s bucket list of cities to visit, so it became part of our travel plans. I was happy to revisit. I had barely any of the great city on my last visit.

Matthew and Kris were on a shoe string budget. This was great, the West Coast Australia trip was going to be costly. Our hostel was situated close to the main railway station; the perfect location. The 4-bunk bed share was very expensive, given its privacy, in a prime location. Given there were 3 of us, there was a spare bunk. Thankfully, a random stranger didn't take it. So we used it to accommodate our luggage. The weather in Melbourne was rainy at the end of November. For the 2 days we were there, we got good mileage out of: our raincoats, artisan coffee shops and pubs offering Chicken Parmigiana and a pint.

The flight to Broome, Western Australia, was a good 8 hours, including 1-stop at Perth Airport. We were all excited about the impending road trip. On arrival at Broome Airport it was apparent that this town wasn't going to be a tourist trap. The runway was a mixture of tarmac and red sand. The departures and arrivals areas were one and the same, housed in a tin roof shelter. For all its quirks it was great to have finally arrived at the road trip start point. The high temperature, 30 degrees Celsius and dry conditions were lovely. A welcome change from the cool, inclement Melbourne weather we left behind.

For all road trips to begin, you need a mode of transport to use on the roads. We had booked a van prior to our arrival through a company named Wicked Campers. I had stored the location of their Broome office in Google Maps on my iPhone. Unfortunately, the estimated time to walk their was a bit too much for tourists slugging around 2 weeks of baggage. We decided to hail a taxi, arriving at the scrap yard looking entrance of Wicked Campers in 5 minutes. As we tried to find the office, we saw a raft of graffitied camper vans. The graffiti was not politically sensitive, and may have even offended an Australian. It is art, as terse as it may be.
Wicked Campers, like many old vehicle hire companies, was not a hygenic environment. Staff had grease, oil and probably chip fat smudged across their exposed skin. We entered the main hangar to see vehicles that needed a lot of repair work.

Having found a representative, we signed the paper work and were led to the forecourt. “Right, this is yours.” the greesy staff member said. I stared at the vehicle for what seemed like an interminable period of time. I crossed my arms, tilted my head and absorbed. It was a Mitsubishi, not any Mitsubishi, a Diesel, 4x4 van called the Delica. It was tall, thin and feminine. The representative explained that there was a knack to starting the Delica. “Remember, it’s a diesel. Make sure the glow plug light goes out before you start the engine.” These would be wise words. It would aide us when the Delica misbehaved first thing on a cool morning.

Kris, Matthew and I shared the burden/pleasure of driving during our trip.
Our whistlestop tour began at Kimberley Klub YHA. We made our way south to a number of nice little campsites including Captain Bert Madigan Park. Most of the campsites offered red sands, outdoor shared bbqs and an array of large creepy crawlies. Karijini Park featured a corrugated track. It took a speed and a firm grip on the steering wheel to ride and glide across the small, even bumps. The canyons at Karojoni Park were shallow, lush, containing little pools and snakes. For Kris, Matthew and even me, we were surprised to  encounter our first Australian snake, the Mulga Snake (the largest venomous snake in Australia). I took a picture of the large brown beauty, at some distance. After spooking the snake, the swiftness in which it moved caught us all by surprise. In Karijini the weather was, as the British would describe it, mildly moist. The moisture did cause the red soil to stick to anything and everything. For the love of cleaning, the red soil could not be completely removed.

"Pitching up" at Karijini National Park involved pulling up just off the corrugated road, setting up the tent and getting some shut eye. When night did arrive and hunger struck we took out the torches and opened the Mitsubishi Delica's boot. It was like the tardis, given the compact size of the van, it had a lot of interior space. In the boot there was a small gas canister, stove and a cool box of food we'd bought in the previous town. That night Kris prepared a tasty vegan dinner: penne pasta with spinach and a creamy sauce. It was so peaceful at our camping location. No road noise and no light pollution. After we finished the delicious food, we relaxed on fold up chairs and chatted over warm-ish bottled beers. When bed time beckoned, Matthew and Kris reorganised the interior of the van. They unleashed the fold down bed, quickly brushed their teeth before pulling the vehicle's door shut. They were secure, out of the element and supported by a lovely mattress. My tent, borrowed from my friend Andy, had the essentials: A roof and a foam mat. Given the dark and silent environment, exiting the tent at night for "light relief" felt scary. Having a spot light angled at my feet, walking in an unfamiliar area. There was every chance: I was going to get lost, eaten or wee'd on (if my bladder was overly-irritated). While trying to get shut-eye in the tent, I heard the unfamiliar sounds of Australia's wildlife. With my heart racing, headtorch flashing and back breaking (due the thin sleeping mat and hard ground) I had a restless sleep that night.

A vigorous dusting off of the tent the next morning meant it was good to safely chuck in the boot. It was blue skies in Karijini. Today, it was possible to take the time to admire the beautiful, arid landscape. The good weather conditions opened up more driving routes within the park on its red sandy tracks. On exiting, it was a joy to hit the tarmac of the sealed roads again. With Kris designated driver of the van I was allowed to relax in the back seat and admire the depth of the outback landscape. The scale of Australia, for a British person, is difficult to contemplate. To not see a vehicle for hours. It was so peaceful, but it would be a long wait for assistance if the delicate Mitsubishi van were ever to break down.

On the journey to Exmouth we stopped off at a caravan park. It was there where we experienced Australia’s largest flightless bird, the emu. It’s a nerve-wracking experience coming face-to-face with a large animal, unfazed by people. The emus hung because they were used to people feeding them. We bought a water melon from a food stall before arriving at the caravan park. When we decided to cut and divide the melon in the shared, outdoor area, the emus were on us. We had to shield what we had and consume as much of it as possible to save ourselves from being pecked to pieces.

We headed to Coral Bay, a pristine lagoon on the way to our next stop, Exmouth. Coral Bay was special; forget the great barrier reef. This experience was accessible from the shore; it offered untouched corral reefs, pristine, clear waters, and up close views of vibrantly colourful fish. It was perfect, unfortunately pristine corral reefs are sharp, as Kris discovered. She scraped her foot, which prematurely suspended her snorkelling experience for the day. Thankfully, a kiss and a band aid was all that was necessary to make it better.

The town of Exmouth was a return back to the world of creature comforts. It was timed perfectly, we had consumed much of our car food supplies. With it being December, Kris found it appropriate to purchase a Santa hat. It was still weird experiencing summery weather in December. We took time to relax on the rocky beaches around Exmoor. One morning, while Matthew and Kris were resting, I decided to take a better look around town. What activities were available? Luck had it, there was a scuba and snorkelling excursion from nearby Ningaloo Reef that was departing in the afternoon. I got back to camp to relay this trip details to Matthew and Kris. Unfortunately, the cost of the excursion was too high. Thankfully, they had no quibbles for me to travel alone.

I wouldn’t be alone aboard our speed boat. There were 6 of us in total: the captain, assistant, a Scandanavian couple, an East Coast Australian and me. The speed boat could have easily accommodated 10 – 20 people. The available space made for a relaxed experience. To make it even more relaxed there were endless supplies of coffee, tea and biscuits. The scuba diving and snorkelling was sublime. We decended 10 metres to the sandy bottom of the clear blue waters. We looked up to see white tipped sharks circle overhead. Even though the white tips were small, I was nervous. It was my first underwater encounter with a shark, an animal made famous by the movie Jaws. I was a lot happier when the group gathered around a rock formation, out of sight of the sharks. It was fascinating observing their behaviour. The sharks chose this particular location, along with many other marine animals, to be cleansed by small fish that lived there. It was like a nature documentary portrayal: A large animal would circle like a plane ready to land at London Heathrow Airport. When it came to its turn in the queue, it would descend close to the rocks. There the “servicing” fish would appear from the nooks and crannies, and feed on the large animal’s parasites. I could have watched this all day.

There was literally an even bigger surprise awaiting in the second part of the excursion. It was billed as “Swimming with Manta Rays”. Initially, there was a problem. There were plenty of green turtles, but no Manta Ray sightings. Ah well, it was looking like the tour might be cut short. An enthusiastic yelp from the boat's captain meant get ready quickly. Fins, wet suit, snorkel, goggles, in to the water. While the group treaded water we listened to the instructions of our leader. We were told to keep within a certain distance of the Manta Ray in a diamond formation. Even though the Manta Ray was a good 5 metres wide, it was easily spooked. In our formation formation we took a closer look. The Ray was so graceful. It calmly beat its wings to propel itself through the clear, shallow waters. It felt humbling being so close to such a massive animal. The group leader manoeuvred herself closer to the Manta Ray, presumably the animal was becoming more comfortable in our presence. The group leader rotated her body head facing skyward. She approached close to the underside of the Manta Ray, looking into its massive filtering mandibles. The group leader indicated the group should move in closer. I was hesitant, I swam closer to the Manta Ray and tried the exact same manoeuvre as the group leader. With some effort I pulled it off and was rewarded with a close-up view of the Manta Ray's underbelly. It was a thrilling yet comfortable experience. Each member of the group took their turn to take a closer look. I wasn’t the only person in the group to feel hesitant. The wide eyes of the other group members revealed their amazement. In a swift flap of the Manta Ray's wings, the beautiful animal was gone. We got back on board the boat, smiled and caressed a warm beverage prepared by the captain. The boat was now heading for the dock. The group chatted, reflecting on the amazing scuba diving and snorkelling experience.

On our journey south we visited Hamlin Pool in the Shark Bay region. It has a significant back story. The detailed information boards described an organism named a Stromatolites that lived in the shallows. They are the oldest and largest living fossils on earth. These organisms are 3.5 billion years old and could barely be seen from the boardwalk we walked across. What Matthew, Kris and I did notice was an open space containing naturally occurring sand sculptures. We took lots of photos. The conditions were perfect, blue skies and intense heat. Kris, Matthew and I, being of Northern European descent, had to ensure we were covered from head to toe in sunscreen. I took the sun protection stance maybe a bit too far at times. I smothered my nose and lips with zinc oxide (a pastey total sunblock), which made me appear like an Aussie cricketer.

Further down the southern coast, Francois Peron National Park offered special views of jelly fish plumes. There must have been thousands of “Blue Bottles”, aka Man O’ War, that stretched the length of the bay. We saw many animal related sign posts along the way too. One rare example was a sign that warned of the elusive Bilby, a type of marsupial rabbit.

Arguably the most memorable and plush tourist destinations on Australia's west coast was Monkey Mia. Up until that point most areas were destitute and remote. Monkey Mia was a resort with loads of amenities: A huge car park, check in, shop, private beach and extensive eating areas. I managed to set my tent up on a well-groomed lawn with loads of space around me. I felt spoilt. Palm trees swayed next to a board walk that led to a white sandy beach. Matthew and I were ecstatic. Once we parked up, we literally dived into the shallow waters of the bay. I was surprised how shallow the water was as I began wading out. I felt anxious as my foot glanced a sting ray that rested, obscured, on the sea bed. I reverted to swimming in the shallows. There was so much sea grass that I saw very little. The sea was like a large warm bath, given the water temperature and depth.

Monkey Mia offered breath-taking views of the surrounding bays that Kris, Matthew and I admired. We sat outside in 20+ degree temperatures sipping on beers we bought from the local shop. There was on site food take away. As good as our cooking had been, a takeaway offered a welcome change and no washing up. The next morning, instead of usually packing up and heading to the highway, we went to the beach. There the resort had an organised spectacle. Each morning a Monkey Mia staff member appeared on the shoreline near their offices. They brought a bucket of gutted fish with them. The person present this morning had a microphone and explained what we were about to experience. It was obvious, given the shape of the dorsil fins nearing the shore. These were dolphins. The staff member explained who the individual Bottlenose Dolphin were. She also exaplined the interlinked history of Monkey Mia and the dolphin pod. Without the dolphins there would be no Monkey Mia. This is what the tourists came here to see and had been doing for the past 30 years.

Once the dolphins has consumed the bucket of gutted fish, it was time for us to hit the road. On the journey to Kalbarri National Park we stopped at many secluded snorkel spots. We ended up arriving into Kalbarri at night. As we arrived, we were welcomed by a road sign spelling out all the town’s offerings: A caravan park, a fish and chip shop and a liquor store. If we had a priority list, that would be it.

The next morning we headed towards Geraldton, the industrial centre of Western Australia. It felt like we were continuously overtaking multi-trailer trucks. The multi-trailer trucks were filled to the brim with excavated riches from the nearby mines. They were by far the slowest thing on the road. To make reasonable time, overtaking them was our only option and an unnerving one at that. Even though the highways were long, straight and wide, the trucks took up a lot of their space. Given the number of articulations they snaked over two lanes. My approach to overtaking was to use every last pony of the Mitsubishi Delica's equestrian power unit. If I saw a convoy of multi-trailer trucks from a distance, I was happy to approach the first truck at full speed. I would get in the truck's slip stream that I would use to slingshot the van into the over-taking lane. There could be more trucks than anticipated in a single convoy. In that case, god willing, there was a space to move our van into, if we were to approach oncoming traffic. Once in an overtaking mindset, I had little appetite for abandoning an overtaking manouveur. I’m sure the truck drivers didn’t want to take their foot off the gas/accelerator either, given how much time and fuel is required to accelerate back up to full speed.

Thankfully there weren’t any incidents, as we successfully overtook many trucks on the journey to Nambung. I was, however, criticized many times by the semi-conscious backseat driver, Kris. She caught me driving a touch above the speed limit when the road was clear. It was in Nambung that we saw a small scale equivalent of Stonehenge. The sand monoliths made for interesting, subjective viewing. “Look at that one, it looks like Rabbit ears”, I declared. Most looked like giant petrified boggies. With so many of these human size abominations, it made for an absurd amount of funny photographic moments. We succeeded in imitating the boggey-like sand monoliths.

We had a long journey ahead, clocking up nearly 12 hours of drive time to reach our next location. Margaret River is huge; you haven't seen the location if you’ve only popped into town. The town feels bohemian with shops selling organically grown produce, surf shops and trendy cafes. Margaret River is world famous for its fine wines. Matthew, Kris and I window shopped in town. We were pleasantly, but not shockingly, surprised to see a travel-agency offering many cycling inspired trips. We took a closer look and found ‘Sip n Cycle - Winery Tour’. On paper the tour didn’t seem like the safest of expeditions, alcohol and exercise usually results in one being sacrificed for the other. Having been sat at the drivers seat of a sardine can for 12 hours, any excuse to move my legs was welcomed. We donned our silver helmets, sunnies & grabbed our hire bikes. We waited outside the travel agents headquarters, while a group of enthusiastic participants arrived.

Thankfully, the pace of the bike ride between winieries was relaxed. The 18km of mostly solid earth terrain was flat as French fromage.Having had some experience wine tasting on my travels, I had a good idea what to expect and how to behave. I did try my best to try and follow the guidance provided by the winery staff. I attempted to look sophisticated. As we travelled to subsequent wineries the alcohol affected my guard. The result, silly photos. Thankfully our bikes were reprimanded by the travel company at our 3rd and final winery. We were subsequently driven back into town where we were re-united with the van.

The beverage sampling didn’t stop there. On driving out of town we found a beautiful country pub close by to a large body of water. It served many locally brewed beers. Matthew and I decided it would be wise to sample each one. Thankfully, the Bootleg Brewery pub had just the setup for us; 8 sample beers, each housed in a shot glass. After the sweet tasting wines, the taste buds were in for a surprise. Deciding which was best wasn’t easy. All the beers were, as is traditional in Australia, refreshingly fizzy. The depth of flavour of each beer swung from tart sourness to malt bodyness. Astonishingly, me being a drinker of darker beers, it was the moderatly tarty lager that won both Matthew’s and my heart.

The magnificence of Margaret River cannot be fully realised until you have seen the Indian Ocean from it's coast. The sea powerfully heaved onto the shore while the sun beckoned from the heavens of the overcast sky. Any location that has a lighthouse is close by to dangerous conditions. Where we were, the lighthouse prominently peered above the rocks. Seeing the sun set from our perch on the rocks was special.

Pemberton is known for its forest of giants trees. The Gloucester Tree or Firemans–Lookout tree was a typical immense example. To ascend to its perch at the top you had to navigate the steel bars that protruded from its trunk. Thankfully, Matthew, Kris and I took the climb in our hesitant, cumbersome strides. The view from the top of The Gloucester Tree, allowed us to see the Eucalypt canopy for as far as the eye could see. The view of the forest floor was equally impressive, but unnerving. On returning to earth we sought a picnic bench to prepare and eat lunch. It was less a scene from Masterchef and more like Doctor Doolittle. Colourful Australian birds arrived. Ring-Necked Parakeets and the Western Rosellas tamely waited to pick up food scraps. With the birds having finished our lunch we chose a number walking. The path that led through the forest of Pemberton's largest trees was by far my favourite.

Dunsborough was a 2 hours drive away. It is home to the maginificent Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park, offering a range of excellent scuba diving sites. Matthew and I, having completed our beginner, open water PADI certification, were interested in one dive in particular. The HMAS Swan Wreck Charter SCUBA Dive offered the diver to see a huge ship wreck.

One beautiful, blue sky morning Matthew and I turned up at the Cape Dive office. We booked, paid and travelled to the beach where the charming sized Cape Dive boat awaited. Onboard I hadn’t a clue how to set up the scuba diving rig. It should have been as simple as ABC: Air, Buoyancy, Clips & Releases (the first two parts of the acronym, yes, the third part…). Thankfully the on-board staff saw the error of my ways as I mistakenly put the airtank on backward. Having correctly set up our breathing and buoyancy aides, it was all a matter of choosing a neoprene wet suit. Unfortunately, all were 2 sizes too big. I tried to appear more proficient by wearing metal Oakley sunglasses, an essential piece of water sports posing equipment. Matthew wore his half-jacket plastic sunnies. They were more functional and arguably prettier than mine. Out of pride I refused to tell him.

It was calm in the bay when we entered the boat. When we ventured out in to deeper waters the water got choppy. The poor dive boat was hitting the water hard as it speedily made its way to the dive location. The only people on board were: Matthew, me, 2 male South Koreans and a married British couple. The 2 South Korean looked nervously at the sea swell. We were instructed by the guide “5 minutes till we enter the water”. Other than the 2 South Koreans, we all readied ourselves and eventually jumped in. I opted to enter the water using the missionary style lunge with arms by my side. The is one issue with this entrance. The mask forces itself deep into the divers eye sockets as the head enters the water.

Once in the water I laughed at the immense size of the ocean swell. It was like nothing I had experienced before or since. I looked over at Matthew, my buddy, to see if he was okay. He gestured the scuba okay sign by pinching his forefinger and thumb together. I felt a sense of relief. I looked over at the 2 Korean tourists; they flapped around like a fish out of water. Both indicated to the divemaster that they were uncomfortable and wanted to get back on board. The divemaster and Koreans duly beelined for the boat. The divemaster quickly returned and indicated to Matthew, me and the Aussie couple to descend. I released some air out of the BCD (Buoyancy Control Device).

As per the onboard briefing, we dived till we met a steel structure that was once part of the HMAS Swan. It was teaming with an attachment of molluscs. Their probes swayed in time with the ocean current. We remained at that depth for a 10 minutes to enable our bodies to adjust to the increase in pressure. The dive master indicated we should follow him as he led us to a depth of nearly 30 metres (my deepest dive ever). The water was surprisingly clear allowing us to admire the exterior of the vesel. We made our way to a rear entrance on the upper deck. Matthew and I were side-by-side as we swam through what was once a hallway. The rooms located either side were lacked windows and doors. As we peered into the rooms, it was amazing to see large scholes of fish. Matthew was more nervous than me, even though I was experiencing buoyancy issues. As we followed the passageway to the lower floor, Matthew was unaware of his missing fin. Thankfully my cat-like buddying skills allowed me to quickly retrieve and fit it back on Matthew's naked foot.

It was surreal heading through various compartments of the huge vessel. Before we knew it we were back at the top of HMAS Swan, dancing with the molluscs, waiting for our bodies to complete the decompression process. We ascended to the ocean's surface and straight back on board. After any dive I get an appetite for sugary food, having drunk far too much sea water. The onboard biscuits went some way to satiate my hunger.

From Dunsborough we made our final road trip journey, to the capital of Western Australia, Perth. Matthew, Kris and I had become somewhat attached to our mode of transport, the Mitsubishi Delica. It had never missed a beat, well technically it did, but on that occassion we somehow we managed to resuscitate it’s cold diesel heart. We entered Fremantle, on the outskirts of Perth, and parked just off the main strip. We had stayed, for the most part, in remote areas. We were now in the densley populated town of Fremantle. The van was covered in red dirt, windows splattered with flies, its non-PC graffiti was still clearly visible. Understandably, we got  unwelcome looks from the Freemantle residents. Unfortunately, it had to defend itself as we took a look around town.

The Moreton Bay Fig trees reached their huge root systems out around Freemantle's Esplanade Park. We walked towards the esplanade, to admire a view of the sea. Matthew frequently checked his phone. He was hoping his old University friend, Lea, would have turned up by now. The last text message Matthew received was, "on my way." The friend's flat was a 10-minute walk away. She indicated we should meet for drinks at the Little Creatures brewery. Matthew, Kris and I found a table outside at the rear of the brewery where we sat, relaxed and drank.

When Matthew and Kris's friend arrived, she brought along a swathe of enthusiasm, which was in stark contrast to out Northern European temperament. We popped next door to say hi to Lea's friends before been driven to Leighton Beach located further up the coast. Leighton Beach hosted the annual Leighton Beach to Rottnest Island kite surfing race. This, the biggest kite surfing race in the Southern Hemisphere was the most expansive sporting event had experienced in my lifetime. 100s of participants could barely be seen as they surfed towards us with the aid of a huge kite. Initially I could only make out a helicopter in the distance. After 10 minutes it was evident that something was out there. In the distance a line of white foam began to develop on the horizon. The kites painted the skies. The best of the participants came into view, looking like bohemian superheroes, levitating above the water's surface. The scale of the kite surfers’ equipment was unmistakeable. The kites were immense. To operate and command such unweildy and dangerous equiment. These atheletes earned my respect.

We returned to our Australian hostess’s humble flat. It had a bohemian vibe. An accoustic guitar stood in the corner of the living room. Up until that point in the road trip I had not held a guitar since we left Sydney. I placed the guitar on my knee and finger slowly picked each string. It was noticably out-of-tune. I began playing my signature tune, Metallica’s “Nothing Else Matters”, to try, by ear, to get it somewhat in tune. I experienced a moment described as “flow” where I was intensely focused as time flew. I don't remember how much time had passed. Thankfully the call of nature forced me to bring my focus back into the room.

As I entered the bathroom I took a good look around. Why were there potted plants, pots and pans in the shower? Why was there an egg timer hanging on the wall? This conundrum distracted me from the original purpose of my bathroom visit. Perth was at a similar longitude to Sydney, but on average it was much hotter thanks to the surrounding geography. I discovered that pots, pans & egg-timers were there for re-use, to make the most of the scarce water in the summer time.

Matthew and Kris slept comfortably in Lea's spare room. I grabbed the sofa, which was a luxury compared to sleeping in the tent. It was reassuring knowing we had reached journey’s end with no dramas. We just needed to make the most of few days we had remaining before heading home.

The next morning we were surprised to see the van undamaged. Its offensive exterior obviously didn't insite anyone's vandalistic tendancies. Wicked Campers rental service was located just around the corner. The garage was a copy of the one in Broome. A random greasy, chip fat stained looking staff member walked approached us to claim the keys back. It was an emotional moment. The Mitsubishi Delica van had been more than simply a means of getting from A to B, it was a memory of the trip.

Another memory of the trip was my beard, which I had grown for 3 weeks. I decided the hair on my face, like the van, had to be returned. A considerable amount of effort was required to complete the task. As I shaved each section I stopped and observed what I looked like. When I saw me with just a moustache I stopped. I thought of my dad, himself a moustache-wearer. He would have been proud. It looked cool; I looked again in the mirror from a myriad of angles and pondered. Should I keep the moustache? I agreed, I had to show the top lip some daylight. With that I whipped off the remaining facial hair and hopped into the shower for a very quick, energy saving shower.

In the afternoon, Matthew, Kris, Lea, her friends and I visited the Little Creatures Brewery for our leaving lunch supplemented by Australia’s best beers. We sat outside. An inviting, warm breeze massaged my freshly shaven face. This last day would be a relaxing one. Social drinking and pub crawling complemented our actions. We migrated onwards to a beautiful Victorian pub named the Sail & Anchor in the centre of Fremantle. Our final stop was Bathers Bay. We sat, drank and witnessed the sun set on the tranquil ocean.

Good times, unfortunately, must come to an end. On the morning of Sunday, 13th December it was time for me to catch a 4-hour flight from Perth to Sydney. Kris and Matthew’s 20-hour journey home to the UK was lengthy in comparison. Back in Sydney, my accommodation, as I discovered was changing again. I was instructed to move to a serviced apartment in a suburb named Homebush.

On the Monday, after a lengthy train journey from Homebush, I was back in the city. I returned to the K.J.Ross & Associates office to work on the bench. During that day I had a call with my manager Mark. His opinion about where I should be located had changed since we had last spoken. He wanted me to organise myself and move to Melbourne immediately. I was elated and shocked to hear this.

The one boon of the Homebush accommodation was its proximity to Sydney Olympic Park (like the trains, built to host the Olympic Games back in the year 2000). The ANZ stadium had hosted many musical performanes. I had watched heavy metal act Metallica play when they toured Australia. On the Monday evening I was to experience Irish rock band U2 on their 360 degrees tour. U2 really knew how to put on a show. The central stage was tailored to the band's performance. It featured an array of colourful, synchronised lights. It was a night to remember; Jay-Z were special guests, playing a selection of tracks that were in collaboration with Linkin Park.

With it being silly (Christmas) season, the whole of the week leading up to Christmas consisted of social drinking opportunities. My expat mates had drinks organised in NewTown; work had Christmas party related drinks organised in Paddington. This didn't include leaving drinks. This was all happening at a time when I had to organise myself for a life in Melbourne. I wondered if Lucinda’s flat in Hawthorn was still available? On the Saturday morning I met up with my good friend Dan Allam to snorkel at Coogee beach. The afternoon was spent socialising with Carl, Uma and their entourage over in the suburb of Rozelle.

Between Saturday 17th December and Thursday 22nd December, my departure date, the stars aligned. I gave all my items in storage to my friend and colleague Teresa. Lucinda’s flat was still available and ready for me to move into. With flight booked, bags packed and passport in hand, the move to Melbourne was going to happen. All I needed was $10 in the wallet. My first stop when I touched down was going to the pub. A parmigiana and a pint please.
